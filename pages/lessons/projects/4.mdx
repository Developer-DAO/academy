PART 1


## Why automated testing?

Testing can:

- prove code actually works
- help you write more modular code
- ensure code doesn't break when you or others make changes or add new features.
  People new to the project may not even know when something breaks without
  tests.
- ensure a bug is fixed and won't come back again
- give you a safety net when you make improvements to the code later

Tests are a tool for writing your code and making sure it keeps working as
expected when changes are made.

Automated tests don't fully replace manually testing your smart contract but
it's an important tool to ensuring your contract will work as expected.

## Let's Get Started

### Setting up our project dependencies

If you have an existing project from your previous work on the TierNFT lesson,
you have all the Hardhat dependencies installed.

Otherwise let's create a new Hardhat project and copy in the contract which
we'll be testing.

{/* DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF NPM? LET'S SEE IF THERE'S IMPROVEMENT */}

To create a new project, please refer to _Lesson 3 - Tier NFTs_ and search for
the “First things first 👷‍♂️" section to get your project going. Follow the steps
until "Let’s start coding”, then open up your code editor.

{/* AND DO WE NEED TO ENSURE LEARNERS ACTUALLY FINISH ALL THE STEPS IN LESSON 3 FOR hardhat configurations, deployment variables, etc */}

_If you are using VSCode, type `code .` in your terminal to open VSCode._

After running through that section you'll have a working Hardhat project for the
next steps.

### Add test command for running tests

Add a line in your `scripts` section of `package.json` so it looks like this
below. You may already have other scripts' lines so don't get rid of those. If
you already have a `"test"` script line, make sure it now has
`hardhat test --network hardhat`. If you have multiple script lines make sure
the last line does not have a comma at the end, otherwise you'll see an error.

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "something": "some other script",
  "test": "hardhat test --network hardhat"
},
```

### Bring in the contract we'll be testing

If you don't already have `TierNFT.sol` in your project from Lesson 3, below is
that same contract. Please create a new file called `TierNFT.sol` in a
`contracts` folder in the root of the project, and copy in this code:

        (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Withdraw failed");
    }
}
```

### Verify Solidity Version

One small, but crucial change before we proceed. Ensure the version of Solidity
being used to run the contract is the same one configured in
`hardhat.config.js`.

Copy the Solidity version from the `pragma` statement at the top of your
contract, to the `hardhat.config.js` file and replace that `solidity: "version"`
with that of your contract.

For example, since our contract is using Solidity `0.8.12`:

```javascript
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox')
require('dotenv').config()

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.12',
}
```

PART 2

## What do we want to test on our TierNFT contract?

Now that the tools are set up, let's talk about what we want to test in our
smart contract. We'll then create the tests.

What is the contract trying to do?

- it accepts payment and mints NFTs
- it renders art as a SVG image
- it allows the contract owner to withdraw funds

If any of these functions are broken, you may not be able to mint NFTs, render
the correct art or withdraw funds at the end.

We want to test that those functions work in a variety of cases.

For example, we can test that a mint happens when enough Eth is spent and that a
mint fails if there is not enough Eth spent.

### Creating our test file

If you don't have one already, create a `test` folder in the root of your
project, and add a new file called `tier-nft.test.js` which will hold our new
test code.

### Start testing constructor(), mint() and withdraw()

Let's start with testing the `constructor` and making sure we can set and
retrieve the NFT name and symbol.

In addition to these first two tests we'll add setup code that we'll reuse for
all the other tests too.

Please add the following code to your new `tier-nft.test.js` file:

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai')

const CONTRACT_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_SYMBOL = 'Tier'

describe('TierNFT', function () {
  let contract
  let owner
  let otherUser

  beforeEach(async function () {
    const Contract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory(CONTRACT_NAME)

    const [_owner, _otherUser] = await hre.ethers.getSigners()
    owner = _owner
    otherUser = _otherUser

    contract = await Contract.deploy(COLLECTION_NAME, COLLECTION_SYMBOL)
    await contract.deployed()
  })

  describe('constructor', async () => {
    it('set proper collection name', async function () {
      const name = await contract.name()
      expect(name).to.equal('TierNFT')
    })

    it('set proper collection symbol', async function () {
      const symbol = await contract.symbol()
      expect(symbol).to.equal('Tier')
    })
  })
})
```

<Callout emoji="💡" size="md" variant="info">
  Before we walk through, let's make sure everything is working correctly. Run
  the tests using `npm test` and you should see these two initial tests pass.
  **This is an important milestone! You created your first tests and they now
  pass.**
</Callout>

Now let's walk through the test code we've pasted in and explain what it does.

<Callout emoji="💡" size="md" variant="info">
  `expect()` from the Chai library is used to test various conditions. There are
  many examples in this lesson.
</Callout>

At the top we see constants with the name and symbol of the NFT collection:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_SYMBOL = 'Tier'
```

Next is a `describe('TierNFT', function () { ...` line. What's cool about
`describe()` is that it logically groups tests together so you'll see nicely
organized output.

When we run the tests we see:

```bash
TierNFT
    constructor
      ✔ set proper collection name
      ✔ set proper collection symbol
```

Notice "TierNFT" comes from the first `describe()` block and `constructor` is
from the inner `describe()` block. The tests are then indented under there.
Makes for a nicely organized suite of tests.

Next notice the `beforeEach()` code block. When tests run it's important that
the contract is deployed from scratch for each test and this is where that
happens. So before each test, this code will run and re-inialize everything,
which prevents one test's results from interfering with another one.

What's happening in `beforeEach()`?

The hardhat framework gives us the tools to deploy our contract to a
locally-running blockchain. So when the `beforeEach()` code finishes the tests
have a fully deployed contract ready to call methods on. In addition there are
two wallets provided by hardhat to use for testing, including `owner` who has
all the permissions, since it deployed the contract, and `otherUser` with fewer
permissions. These will be handy when testing withdraw later on.

Those `let` statements above are to hold these values so we can use them
throughout all our tests.

Finally we then come across our first two actual tests:

```javascript
it('set proper collection name', async function () {
  const name = await contract.name()
  expect(name).to.equal('TierNFT')
})

it('set proper collection symbol', async function () {
  const symbol = await contract.symbol()
  expect(symbol).to.equal('Tier')
})
```

They each call a method and verify the results. "Is the contract name really
TierNFT?" "Is the contract symbol really Tier?"

<Callout emoji="💡" size="md" variant="info">
  You'll notice a lot of `await` statements. That's because most of these calls
  are asynchronous. Without `await` the program would keep going without waiting
  for the result. You may want to take a detour and learn more about what those
  do, but for now, think of them as basically waiting for an asynchronous call
  to return before moving on to the next line.
</Callout>

### General testing concepts

- Tests should be as simple as possible. By moving setup code into
  `beforeEach()` that helps keep it easy to focus on the test itself. If you
  pack too much into a test, you could introduce bugs in the test code itself
  that may lead to incorrect results, and if something fails it may be hard to
  debug which piece is actually broken.
- Therefore it's best practice to have many separate tests with one `expect` in
  each. In practice we could have tested both the name and the symbol in one
  test, but see bullet 1 above!
- And basically every test has two pieces (in addition to the `beforeEach()`
  setup code): a call of a method to be tested, and code to see if the expected
  result happened.

Lastly when you write a test, always make sure it fails first! So try changing
the `expect` line to test the name `Anita` instead of `TierNFT`, run the test
via `npm test` and make sure it fails. If your test passes when you make an
obvious change like that, something is wrong with your test.

So after intentionally causing one of our tests to fail, here is what the
failure looks like:

```bash

  TierNFT
    construction
      1) set proper collection name
      ✔ set proper collection symbol


  1 passing (2s)
  1 failing

  1) TierNFT
       construction
         set proper collection name:

      AssertionError: expected 'TierNFT' to equal 'Anita'
      + expected - actual

      -TierNFT
      +Anita
```

PART 3

### Let's add tests for mint()

Now is time to add tests for our `mint()` method. We'll group these new tests
into a new `describe` section.

Where exactly do we add this `describe` block?

Currently the end of our `tier-nft.test.js` looks like this, with just one
additional comment line I added that says
`// this is where existing describe section ends`:

```javascript
  describe('constructor', async () => {
    it('set proper collection name', async function () {
      const name = await contract.name()
      expect(name).to.equal('TierNFT')
    })

    it('set proper collection symbol', async function () {
      const symbol = await contract.symbol()
      expect(symbol).to.equal('Tier')
    })
  })
  // this is where existing describe section ends
})
```

Our new `describe` section show below will replace that line that says
`// this is where existing describe section ends`.

<Callout emoji="💡" size="md" variant="info">
  Make sure you keep that last line `})` which is the very end of the block of
  code that holds **all** of the `describe` blocks you're adding in this whole
  lesson.
</Callout>

```javascript
describe('mint', async () => {
  it('should not mint if value is below the minimum tier', async function () {
    await expect(
      contract.mint({
        value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.001'),
      }),
    ).to.be.revertedWith('Not enough value for the minimum Tier')
    await expect(await contract.totalSupply()).to.equal(0)
  })

  it('should increase total supply', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.totalSupply()).to.equal(1)
  })

  it('should mint Tier 0', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.tokenTier(1)).to.equal(0)
  })

  it('should mint Tier 1', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.02'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.tokenTier(1)).to.equal(1)
  })

  it('should mint Tier 2', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.05'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.tokenTier(1)).to.equal(2)
  })
})
```

<Callout emoji="💡" size="md" variant="info">
  Run the tests using `npm test`
</Callout>

These tests introduce additional code that are helpful when testing contracts.

With minting, one needs to pay the right price, we should also see the total
supply of TierNFTs increase with each mint, and since we're minting 3 different
tiers, we need to test each one of those gets minted based on the right price.

The first test is a great example of how to test to ensure an expected error
occurs. If not enough Eth is sent, the contract fails with an error and the
transaction is reverted as if nothing happened.

In this first test we want to ensure our method call is properly reverted when
the proper amount of Eth is not provided. This happens here:

```javascript
await expect(
  contract.mint({
    value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.001'),
  }),
).to.be.revertedWith('Not enough value for the minimum Tier')
```

We're expecting the call to be reverted when not sending enough payment, along
with a specific error message from the contract.

Here we're just calling `mint()` with a parameter that sets the amount of Eth we
want to send. In this case `0.001` Eth is less than our contract minimum of
`0.01` Eth so this correctly fails. Our test confirms this.

Now for the remaining mint tests, these all depend on a successful mint, so they
all need to mint with a minimum of `0.01` Eth. You'll see the same line at the
top of the remaining tests in this section.

And each of those remaining tests has a single `expect()` line to test the
various conditions upon a successful mint. The tier-related tests each put in
enough Eth to trigger a mint for the correct tier.

Notice each line tests the first token (`contract.tokenTier(1)`). Remember that
each test starts from scratch with no supply of NFTs, so after you mint one in a
test, you just have one token, the first one.

### Testing withdraw()

Let's look at testing `withdraw()` next with these 3 tests:

```javascript
describe('withdrawal', async () => {
  it('should error if not owner', async function () {
    await expect(contract.connect(otherUser).withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith(
      'Ownable: caller is not the owner',
    )
  })

  it('should error if balance is zero', async function () {
    await expect(contract.withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith(
      'Balance should be > 0',
    )
  })

  it('should success if owner', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    })
    expect(await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(contract.address)).to.equal(
      hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    )
    await contract.withdraw()
    expect(await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(contract.address)).to.equal(
      hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0'),
    )
  })
})
```

<Callout emoji="💡" size="md" variant="info">
  Run the tests using `npm test`
</Callout>

You'll see similar patterns from the previous `mint()` tests. Here are a couple
of additional highlights:

- In the contract, only `owner` can withdraw funds, so the first test changes
  the user to `otherUser` and makes sure that wallet can not mint. The snippet
  to change wallets before calling the method is: `contract.connect(otherUser)`.
- Another condition to test is that an error is raised if an owner tries to
  withdraw from a zero-balance contact
- Finally let's make sure an owner can successfully withdraw funds. Notice the
  `withdraw()` method call is surrounded by
  `hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(contract.address)` lines. When we mint we know
  the contract now has `0.01` Eth so we check that. Then after running
  `withdraw`, check the balance again and it should be back to zero since all
  funds are withdrawn. Ok, yes we do have two `expect()` lines in one test that
  breaks our rule of one expect per test, but as long as the test is kept
  simple, we can choose what makes sense for what we're trying to test.

PART 4

### Testing tokenURI()

Here's where things get even more interesting!

Notice the current version of `tokenURI()` in our contract outputs a giant
opaque Base64 string that's not discernable by humans. For example the text
"Hello World" when encoded is `SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=`
([Base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/))

This is impossible to test because if you make a change to the code, you get a
different Base64 string. But how do you know if it's correct?

You need to refactor this method into smaller helper methods, each of which are
more testable.

But first let's use the power of testing to make sure we don't break the
implementation as we refactor. Let's wrap `tokenURI()` with a test that **DOES**
capture this opaque string. This gives us a "safety net" as we refactor our
code. If we break things while dividing this problem into helper methods, the
test will help us discover that. We can then toss this test at the end.

Here's an example of what that looks like:

```javascript
it('should return base64-encoded data for tokenURI for Tier 0', async function () {
  await contract.mint({
    value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
  })
  await expect(await contract.tokenURI(1)).to.equal(
    'data:application/json;base64, <full string removed to fit in lesson>',
  )
})
```

First, here's the new contract that now contains a bunch of new helper methods
to make `tokenURI()` testing possible.

You'll still see `tokenURI()` but its implementation now calls several new
helper methods.

Let's quickly describe the new helper methods you'll see below. Each one breaks
down the "create an encoded SVG" problem into manageable functions that can each
be tested and understood by humans writing these tests.

- `tierNameOf()` just takes one of 3 tiers and returns the name of that tier.
  Easy to test!
- `imageSVGOf()` just concatenates three values into a string. Also easy to
  test.
- `finalJSON` also just concatenates multiple values into a string, and like the
  method says, it creates a string that represents the final JSON blob.
- Notice that none of these methods does the Base64 encoding, which immediately
  makes it impossible for a human to interpret the results and that makes for a
  bad test.
- So that does leave some lifting at the end still in `tokenURI()` but it's much
  simpler now. It calls well-tested helper methods that do the heavy lifting and
  finally does the dreaded Base64 encoding. Which tests, and how many to write,
  is subjective. In this case the non-automated-tested part is minimized and a
  test wasn't added. Though it is possible someone will come along, and with a
  typo break this file. It's up to you as a tester to decide if more tests are
  needed for peace of mind.

The final test is an example mentioned earlier about adding a test before
refactoring with helper methods. It checks that the initial `tokenURI()` method
(which returns an encoded Base64 string) returns the right result. It's helpful
while refactoring to make sure we didn't break things along the way, and it's
helpful at the end to ensure the `tokenURI()` method continues to work without
fail when code changes.

OUTRO

## Food for Thought

With all the helpfulness of tests, why didn't we start with them before we wrote
any of the contract implementation?

The main reason was trying to minimize all the things you needed to learn to get
started, but the methodology of writing tests first is called "Test Driven
Development" (TDD).

TDD is a very powerful methodology which goes like this:

- before you write implementation code, you write one or more tests and run
  them.
- of course those tests fail initially since there are methods that don't have
  any implementaiton yet. As mentioned earlier, it's always important to prove
  your test fails initially.
- then add your implementation until the tests pass.

Voila!

With TDD:

- you would have written tests as you go, which are much more fun to write than
  all at once at the end
- you would have ended up writing better code because you discover quickly when
  code is impossible to test. You'll end up with the added benefit of breaking a
  big method into multiple smaller methods that are easily testable. So in the
  refactor example above for `tokenURI()` you would never have written the
  version that outputs a long base64 string because it's not testable.

  Bolting on tests after the fact can be painful and boring, and you lose the
  potential code improvements you can make when you test as you go.
