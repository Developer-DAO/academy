## About this lesson

Welcome to this lesson on creating a series of NFTs using Solidity smart contracts with a range of developer tools. If you are new to programming, we recommend you first complete our *Getting Started with Smart Contract Development* project, where you can learn the basics of Solidity and the some of the concepts we use in this lesson. We alst have a series of follow-up projects to this one, the next one being *TierNFTs*, but let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.

We have some checkpoint questions for you throughout the lesson for testing either your previous knowledge, predicting next steps in the lesson, or letting you see for yourself how well you're absorbing the new content. Needless to say, there's a quiz at the end, so make sure you're checking out all the side-drawers for a deeper dive of the new concepts. To complete the lesson, expect somewhere between two and six hours depending on your previous experience and the need to learn new ideas. Let's make developing enjoyable, by taking care of our well-being. We have a pomodoro timer ⌛ for you to set in the menu header so you can take regular breaks, and please *do* go outside and 'touch some grass'😊. Nature is the source of much of our well-being.

PART 1 INTRO
## What are we buidling?

In this project we will build a basic NFT smart contract, that will serve us as
the backbone or foundation for almost any future NFT project.

**Why?** Because NFTs are not just jpegs, they carry many superpowers that could
improve our lives in many ways.

**What is an NFT?** NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. It is basically a crypto
token that is unique and cannot be replaced, because
there is no other token that is identical in utility and therefore value.

**So, what can we do with them?** Since they live on the blockchain and are
unique, we can use them to verify ownership of a real world asset (real estate
deeds, art), to represent a membership (club membership, fan club), to track
real world items in a supply chain (medicine, food, clothing), to use as tickets
(movies, events, concerts, VIPs) and many more use cases we have yet to
discover.

**But, what is it with all the hype around them?** As well as being unique, they have the
ability to carry properties inside them. The value inherent to blockchains and
the fact ownership can be transferred, leads to people attaching value to them.
This has created huge opportunities for individuals, marketplaces and platforms to trade, transfer or issue these assets.

Now that we know they can be much more than just an image, what are we waiting for!

By the end of this lesson we are going to learn a lot of things. A simple breakdown of the steps to get there is:

- Set up our environment to work
  - Install dependencies
  - Create a project
- Create a Smart Contract using a code editor
- Use images and files for our NFTs
  - (Optional) Create your own images and files and store them in a decentralized way
- Deploy our Smart Contract to a Testnet Blockchain
- *Mint*, i.e. create our very own NFT
- See our NFT in a public marketplace

PART 2 TOOLS/ENVIRONMENT
## Set up your environment

Like the pros. For that we are going to set up our working environment in our
computer, making sure we have all the necessary tools to create, debug and
deploy smart contracts.

![expectations.reality.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_2.jpeg)

To begin our project, we should open a console (check your Operating System
options on how to use one).

We will be using `npm`, the package manager from Node, and its command `npx`
that allows us to run or execute a package or one of its scripts. If you are
comfortable with another package manager, feel free to use it.

<SideDrawer title=" " buttonText="How to install NPM on your system">
  <InstallNpm/>
</SideDrawer>

Let’s create and `cd` into our D_D Academy projects folder, and create a
folder for our NFT project:

```bash
# create a folder for all our D_D Academy projects
mkdir d_d_academy
cd d_d_academy

# create a folder for this project
mkdir projectNFT
cd projectNFT

# initialize our folder as an npm package
npm init -y

# install hardhat (and its dependencies)
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>
The `--save-dev` flag used in the last command, lets the project know it's a
development dependency (not needed in production). You can view what
dependencies are needed in the `package.json` file in the root of the project.
</Callout>

## Create your project

Once we have our environment set up, we need to create a project.

![you.shall.not.pass.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_3.jpeg)

We run the `npx hardhat` command to create a basic project:

<SideDrawer buttonText="What on Earth is Hardhat?">
  Since we’re flying to Jupiter, we need safety apparel! That’s what Hardhat is.

  It provides a blockchain for us along the way, where we can have lots of value
  on it, and we can waste as much as we want and get hit on the head with
  asteroids without getting any scars.
  
  Hardhat lets us do all the things we did in Remix, but instead of clicking
  ‘Deploy’ and ‘Compile’ buttons, or reading our logs from inside the browser
  IDE, we will be writing our commands in the console and debugging our errors
  from a code editor on our ‘local’ computer.

  Hardhat is simply a set of tools that includes a local mini blockchain that
  can run on your machine.
</SideDrawer>

After you enter your `npx hardhat` command, what information can you see? What
are those ten lines and what is?

```less
// 888    888                      888 888               888

// 888    888 "Y888888 888     "Y88888 888  888 "Y888888  "Y888

👷 Welcome to Hardhat v2.11.1 👷

? What do you want to do? … 
❯ Create a JavaScript project
  Create a TypeScript project
  Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
```

We choose `Create a Javascript project` and hardhat will create an example
project for us. It will give us 3 prompts for options. Choosing the defaults is
ok for us. Here's what mine asked me:

```less
✔ What do you want to do? · Create a JavaScript project
✔ Hardhat project root: · ~/d_d_academy/projectNFT
✔ Do you want to add a .gitignore? (Y/n) · y
✔ Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox)? (Y/n) · y
```

- **Hardhat project root** → Hit enter (this is the folder where we want to create the project)
- **Do you want to add a .gitignore?** → Select 'y'. If you are patient to
  finish the lesson, you'll learn what it's for
- **Do you want to install this sample project's dependencies with npm (…)?** →
  Select 'y'. These are packages (programs) that our project needs to be able to
  run.

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>
The project asked us to install `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox` in the
last prompt. If they didn’t install or we accidentally chose ‘n’, we can always
install them manually with:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers
```
</Callout>

We delete some files so we start fresh:

```bash
rm contracts/*.sol
rm scripts/*.js
rm test/*.js
```

In a Hardhat project, the default folders are supposed to be for:

default paths

- `contracts/` is where the source files for your contracts should be.
- `scripts/` is where simple automation scripts go.
- `test/` is where your tests should go.

We now need to add our last dependency (OpenZeppelin contracts):

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>
Open Zeppelin developed a lot of standard contracts that are super powerful,
widely used and fully tested and audited.

PART 3 SOLIDITY/TOKEN STANDARDS
## Let’s start coding!

With our project folder ready, we can now fire up our Code Editor.

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>
We are using VSCode for this one (we think it has a good balance of costs vs.
benefits) but you can use whatever you feel comfortable with. A few of the more
popular code editors are VSCode, Atom, Sublime, Vim, emacs, and many more.

</Callout>

Enough rambling, let’s start writing our contract!

![code.i.write.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_4.jpeg)

In your console, type `code .` and yes, with that dot at the end! Wait for the
magic.

Let’s create an empty file named `ProjectNFT.sol` inside the `contracts/` folder
and copy this code inside:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.12;

contract ProjectNFT {
}
```

If you’ve been through our
[first project](/lessons/projects/1), you’ll remember the first lines defines our
copyright license, the second one defines the solidity version we are going to
be using for this contract and the last two lines are how we declare a smart
contract in solidity.

With an empty project, now we can start adding what we need to create our
awesome NFT collection. In particular, ERC721 (the
formal specification to follow for NFTs) have a lot of requirements to meet
(they should have a numbered ID, functions to transfer them, approve others as
delegates to transfer them, etc).

<SideDrawer title=" " buttonText="More about Token Standards">
  <TokenStandards/>
</SideDrawer>

All of it is pretty much for our project, but luckily OpenZeppelin has developed
a lot of contracts that implement these standards and more. They are widely
used and audited, and the thing we love about them, they are open-source and we
can use them to leverage our learning process. With that in our heads, we are
going to use them inside our contract.

## Standing on the shoulder of giants

For this we are going to ‘inherit’ (think of _using the properties of_ or
_extending_ for now) the ERC721 contract from OpenZeppelin. In the same way you
_inherit_ the DNA and characteristics from your family/relatives.

![standing.in.the.shoulder.of.giants.nft.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_5.jpeg)

This is what we need in our code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.12;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract ProjectNFT is ERC721 {

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol)
        ERC721(_name, _symbol) {}

}
```

- After our pragma statement, we add an `import` statement, that lets us use the
  contracts in the `ERC721.sol` file.
- Next, we add `is ERC721` to our `contract ProjectNFT` statement. This lets us
  inherit all the variables, functions, events, etc from `ERC721` into the new
  `ProjectNFT` contract, where we can use them, as if they were its own, as well
  as any new code we write.
- Every contract has a `constructor` function. This is called only once when the
  contract is first deployed. The `ERC721` `constructor` which we will inherit
  has two parameters, so we need to assign them arguments i.e. an actual name
  and symbol for our NFT. Therefore, we will create a new constructor, while
  still inheriting the `ERC721`’s. Our `constructor` will receive 2 parameters
  and call the `ERC721` constructor with them. Composability, eh?

## Whose is whose?

We need to identify our NFTs, this is what gives each one its uniqueness on the
blockchain.

![spiderman.pointing.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_6.jpeg)

We are going to use a state variable to keep track of the total supply of NFTs,
which we can use as our ID for each new token created:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.12;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract ProjectNFT is ERC721 {

    uint256 private totalSupply;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol)
        ERC721(_name, _symbol) {}

}
```

We made our totalSupply variable private and it will store exactly how many NFTs
have been minted so far. In the next step we will use this variable to identify
each new NFT that’s created.

      <Question question="lesson-2/3-sol-erc/Q5" />
</SideDrawer>
<br/>

PART 4. NFT IDENTITY

## Mint… Feels Good

Once we have a way to identify our NFTs, we only need a way to create them.

![mint.feels.good.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_7.jpeg)

We will add a function to **mint** new items, and yes, that means creating a new
NFT:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.12;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract ProjectNFT is ERC721 {

    uint256 private totalSupply;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol)
        ERC721(_name, _symbol) {}

    function mint() public {
        totalSupply++;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, totalSupply);
    }

}
```

What our `mint` function does first is increment our `totalSupply` state
variable by 1, because our collection will have one item more. Then it calls a
function from our inherited `ERC721` contract called `_safeMint` that allows a
new item to be added to our ProjectNFT contract.

As you can see, OpenZeppelin implementation takes care of all the heavy lifting,
but later in our learning journey we will be able to understand how it all works
inside the hood.

## Ok but, what does it do?

We can create unique NFTs by now, but we didn't add any media or utility to them
just yet.

![cmon.do.something.nft.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_8.jpeg)

We are missing the last piece of the puzzle. For now they are just a numbered
proof of ownership from our contract, stored on the blockchain. So here is where
the magic starts.

We can make our NFT collection about anything we want: text, images, music,
videos, anything you want. But how?

The `ERC721` implementation we inherited has a function to store a `tokenURI`.

What is this black magic? This is just a unique URI, a web address if you prefer,
that points to something on the internet, whatever we want it to be. e.g. a video,
an image.

OpenZeppelin ERC721 contract provides us a way to create unique URIs from the
IDs of the NFTs. It gives a way to define a base path for a web address and just
attaches the token ID at the end of it. So, if you wanted, you could upload your
NFT info (we'll look at how we store that later) to any web address, say
`www.my-site.com/my-nft-collection`
and number each info file with the corresponding ID (1, 2, 3, 4…).

We are not going to limit the size of our collection for this project.

So, to let our inherited contract know where our NFTs will be stored, we have to
`override` an OpenZeppelin function. Actually, you are expected to do this if
you look into OpenZeppelin's documentation. There’s a good reason for
everything. Well, lots of things. And this is one of them!

Here's the modifications we will add and I'll explain them below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.12;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract ProjectNFT is ERC721 {

  uint256 private totalSupply;
  string private ipfsBaseURI;

  constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, string memory baseURI)
    ERC721(_name, _symbol) {
      ipfsBaseURI = baseURI;
    }

  function mint() public {
    totalSupply++;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, totalSupply);
  }

  function _baseURI() internal view override returns (string memory) {
    return ipfsBaseURI;
  }

}
```

What have we done?

- We added a state variable where we will store the base of the URI for the NFTs
- We added a 3rd parameter to our constructor, so we can store our base URI when
  we deploy the contract to the blockchain
- Inside the constructor, we assign this new parameter to our new state variable
- Finally, we create a function that has the `override` modifier to indicate
  that this function replaces the one that is inside our inherited contract.

Internally, when someone needs to consult an NFT's info, they call the
OpenZeppelin's `tokenURI` function. That function only joins the return
***value*** of our newly `_baseURI`function with the ID of the token requested.

With that we can see the power of inheritance and overriding. We can inherit a
whole set of functionalities and change only what we need to create a different
experience.

![im.something.of.a.scientist.myself.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_9.jpeg)

## Media for our NFTs

We have most of our smart contract ready, so we are going to focus on the media
that we want on our NFTs.

We propose a *choose your own adventure* for this part of the project:

- If you want to go quickly into deploying the contract, you can use the images
and files that we prepared, and move on to the next section.

- If you want to create your own images and have an NFT of your own, why not take the winding road and learn a little about the standard used to identify NFTs
and a solution to store files in a decentralized way.

PART 5 JSON/IPFS (SEPARATE SIDE DRAWER QUIZ)

<SideDrawer buttonText="Longer Path (learn about JSON and IPFS)">
## JSON

We have most of our smart contract ready, so we are going to focus on the media
that we want on our NFTs.

To keep all our LEGO pieces composable, marketplaces also use a standard to
display info for our NFTs, and that means we create a file with our NFT
information (name, description, image and attributes), and that file will point
to our media.

For that we are using a `.json` file. JSON stands for JavaScript Object
Notation.

![json-meme_-500x500.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_10.jpeg)

Our JSON files will basically look like this, after adding some spaces for
readability:

```json
{
  "name": "D_D_Academy",
  "description": "This is the NFT Description",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/LQPJINE.png",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Background", "value": "Starry" },
    { "trait_type": "Hat", "value": "Graduation" },
    { "trait_type": "Mouth", "value": "Smile" },
    { "trait_type": "Eyes", "value": "Open" }
  ]
}
```

In case you didn't notice, it's just a way to describe objects as key-value
pairs, e.g. “Background” is the key, “Starry” is the value.

For our project we will need to create the same number of JSON files we plan our
collection to have as NFTs. Each of them will have as a minimum a “name”,
“description” and “image” along with the values that we want them to be.

As you see in the example, under “image” we have a link to a file on the web,
which we will refer to as Web2. So, if this website were to go down, our NFTs
would lose their images, showing us the limitations of the centralization of
web2 data storage.

![nft.pepe.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_11.jpeg)

For us to achieve a higher level of decentralization and availability, we are
going to have to go to the moon…

## To the moon…

Literally.

There are many services that let us store files in a decentralized manner. We
are using the one called IPFS. Inter-Planetary File System. Yep, no joke.

![ipfs.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_12.jpeg)

For a one line explanation, nothing better than quoting the docs: “**IPFS is a
distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and
data**”

<SideDrawer buttonText="More on Decentralized Storage" title="&nbsp;">
  <DecentralizedStorage />
</SideDrawer>

It runs on top of a network of nodes that replicate the data being uploaded. A
computer that downloads a file using IPFS, also shares that file with others for
a limited amount of time. You can make content available more permanently by
*pinning* it, until you decide to *unpin* it.

To ease our path into the IPFS network, services for *pinning* content (e.g.
Pinata) offer paid and free tiers that ensure that the files we upload are
*pinned* in IPFS.

So, go ahead and grab yourself a free pinata account at this
[link](https://www.pinata.cloud/).

One of the peculiarities of IPFS is that files, or better called ‘content’, are
not referenced by name but by its 'CID'. It stands for Content IDentifier, and
that's because that jumble of letters is a hash of the content. Instead of being
location-based, IPFS addresses a file by *what's in it*, i.e. its *content*. The
content identifier is a *unique cryptographic hash* of the content at that
address.

Pretty something, right?

Once you got your account, try to upload a few images for our first NFTs.

Ok, now that you have uploaded the images, videos, audio or whatever you want
your NFTs to point at, you need to create the `.json` files in your preferred
text editor. We must name them as numbers (1,2,3,…) without extension, so our
solidity function `tokenURI` works. It will work somewhat like this:

![ipfs explained.2x.png](/assets/lessons/2/img_13.png)

To see an example of the files on the diagram, you can open the
[json files folder](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVugFDxagshJ4wCGYhGocCMURCfgsyJW7APNCPnS6nx7S)
here, and the images are
[here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZskMvDzm5qbnkV2mzE6Acun78gZEsD7eCVii5YCSR6CB),
[here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmbry7cFd1yb5XCD41EnDKrt8Pp9Zes7g9E71PUSs1RFnw)
and
[here](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qma2rLNBm4cQ2RXxYt75cRJ42NJHPXXyCZPi9p3Wi4n9et).

Pay special attention to the json files folder, when you add `/1` to the end of
the link, it opens the 1st json file, and does the same for the rest of the ids.
To achieve this, you need to add the json files all at the same time, as a
**folder** into pinata, and then you get a CID for the folder, which you can
reference with the filenames at the end for each file.

Remember `_baseURI` function in our solidity contract? The one that was used to
create the NFT tokenURI? There's where we are going to get the pinata link with
the CID to our folder.

And, if we filled our JSON files correctly, each with the corresponding CID of
our media, we should be good to go.

Here is a screenshot of how we have set up our files in pinata for this project:

![Pinata Setup.png](/assets/lessons/2/img_14.png)

You could use our CID for your project (remember the files are there, just like
when you publish an image in imgur or any other web2, only ours is
decentralized). However, we feel that getting your feet wet and interacting with
an IPFS service will surely help you get ahead in your learning.

Have your json files folder IPFS link saved (the full link, that links to all
the files), for we will use it in our next step.

PART 6 SCRIPTS AND COMPILE
## Deploy! Back to Solidity... kind of...

You might remember this from the previous project, when we used Remix. Once we
have our contract ready, we can compile and deploy. In Remix, we had a bunch of
buttons in the web interface, but now we are getting pro, a.k.a. doing it all
ourselves, with the console.

Why did we deviate from Solidity? Because of the way we set our contract up.
When we deploy we tell our contract where our files are stored. Therefore we had
to store the files somewhere to get the address we need to run the deployment.

So, now that we have our media and JSONs uploaded, we can deploy our NFT
contract!

![deploy.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_15.jpeg)

Remember that scripts folder at the beginning of our project? That's where we
are going to create our script to tell Hardhat the set of instructions to
follow. We can create one for deploy, another one to mint or call functions of
our contract. Hardhat uses javascript for this.

So, let's create a `deploy.js` under the `scripts/` folder and copy this code:

```jsx
// import Hardhat to use it inside our script
const hre = require('hardhat')

// We define a variable with the name of our contract
const CONTRACT_NAME = 'ProjectNFT'

// The 3 parameters for our smart contract's constructor (CHANGE THIS!!!)
const NFT_NAME = 'Academy'
const NFT_DESCRIPTION = 'D_D Academy Basic NFT Collection'

// Change this if you created your own images/JSONs:
const NFT_BASE_URI = 'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSCNdaA5JBT5D6V5FbivfZonKjdsMPeZeTyTWzq1D3yrJ/'

// We define a function with all we want Hardhat to run
async function main() {
  // We get the contract factory from Hardhat
  const ContractFactory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory(CONTRACT_NAME)

  // We deploy the contract (notice we pass 3 parameters that our contract's constructor needs)
  const contract = await ContractFactory.deploy(
    NFT_NAME,
    NFT_DESCRIPTION,
    NFT_BASE_URI,
  )

  // We wait for it to be deployed to the blockchain
  await contract.deployed()

  // We print the contract's address to the console
  console.log(`${CONTRACT_NAME} deployed to: ${contract.address}`)

  // --> ( We'll add more stuff here later ) <--
}

// We call the main function we created above (don't change this)
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

The code has comments outlining what each section does, but it basically has 1
variable for our contract's name so the script knows which contract to deploy,
and 3 more variables for the data our constructor needs: a Name, a Description
and a Base URI for our files. With that info set at the top, the script deploys
the contract, waits for it to be deployed and then prints the address of our
deployed contract to the console.

Before we run our script, we need to tell Hardhat what solidity version our
contracts are using. For that, we need to go into the `hardhat.config.js` file
in our root folder. Find the line that says `solidity: '0.8.xx',` and replace
the `0.8.xx` for the pragma used in our contract: `0.8.12`.

We could have used a range of solidity versions e.g. `^0.8.0` in our contract,
but we like to promote best practices by choosing a fixed solidity version
and knowing beforehand nothing is going to change in our bytecode if a new
version in that range is released.

Now, to run the script we type this in the console:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

This is the output i got:

![deploy.output.png](/assets/lessons/2/img_16.png)

Notice that ‘Compiled 10 Solidity files successfully’? But we only wrote 1
Solidity file!

Well, we are actually inheriting some of OpenZeppelin's implementations, so the
compiler also has to process everything we are importing in our contract.

Since we are in a development environment, Hardhat provides us with the tools to
run this in a local blockchain, without the hassle of dealing with blockchain
times, tokens to pay gas for our deployment, etc. This means our contract was deployed to a dummy blockchain Hardhat created, it all went well, and then the blockchain gets deleted.

Taking advantage of this, we are going to add a mint after the deploy to test if
all goes well.

Let's add these lines after the console.log part, right where we left a
placeholder before in our deploy.js file:

```jsx
	// --> ( We'll add more stuff here later ) <--

  // We call the contract to mint 1 NFT
  const tx = await contract.mint()

  // We wait for the transaction to finish
  await tx.wait()

  // We ask for the tokenURI of the recently minted NFT
  // (we assume 1 is the tokenId  since we only minted one)
  const tokenURI = await contract.tokenURI(1)

  // We print out the tokenURI
  console.log(`NFT 1 tokenURI: ${tokenURI}`)

}
```

Let's run the script again and see what it tells us! Here's my output:

![deploy.output.2.png](/assets/lessons/2/img_17.png)

We got the URI of the token, right? So, now we know we can deploy it (and mint)
to a real blockchain!

PART 7 DEPLOY. TESTNETS. WALLETS. OPENSEA

## Things just got real!

For us to get our contract out of our computers and into the real world, we are
going to run the deploy again, but this time to a testnet.

What is a testnet? It is a basically a whole running blockchain, but it runs
only so people can try stuff out. On it, you have eth, tokens, NFTs, but they have no monetary value. This way, you can develop and test your contracts without fear of losing real money. For the moment, we are choosing to do this on the Goerli (it's one of the many Ethereum testnets)

Before we go any further, let's take an extra step for precaution, until the
next project where we are going to learn how to use collaborative tools to store
our projects. But until then, let's open our main folder's `.gitignore` file an
add this line anywhere:

```bash
hardhat.config.js
```

In order to do this we need:

- An ethereum wallet that can connect to Goerli.
  [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is the most used.
- Some Goerli-Eth. You can ask for some in a faucet, it's free, although
  some are faster than others! Options: [#1](https://goerlifaucet.com/),
  [#2](https://faucets.chain.link/goerli), [#3](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)
- An API Key from an Ethereum RPC Node Provider
([Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://infura.io/),
[Ankr](https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli))
- A minor change in the Hardhat Configuration file

First and foremost, **security**. We are exploring new grounds, experimenting
and by doing so, we could make mistakes that we don't want to happen where we
have our money.

We **strongly** recommend you use a separate wallet for developing, completely
independent from the one that holds your personal assets on the blockchain, if you have any.

Wallets have a special number, called a private key. You should **never**,
**ever** share your private keys with **anyone**. If anyone has that number,
they can take full control of the wallet, and empty it of all that is in it!

![keys.jpeg](/assets/lessons/2/img_18.jpeg)

To be able to deploy our contract, we are going to use that number, that's why
we recommend, yet again, to use a separate wallet for developing.

We need to inform Hardhat what node are we using to connect to the
blockchain/network

Once you have your wallet funded with test eth, you need sign up for one of the
Ethereum RPC Node Providers. Alchemy and Infura are the most used, Ankr has a "community endpoint" without signing up that is not dedicated, to list a few options.

Once you sign up, you'll be asked to create an App, be sure to select the
Goerli network there.

When the app is created, you'll see a "View Key" button, or similar. Press it
and copy the HTTP link, we'll use it in our next step.

Once you have funded your wallet with fake eth, we can go ahead and change our
Hardhat configuration file. Go into your main project's folder and open
`hardhat.config.js`.

We are going to replace our file with this:

```jsx
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers')
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');

const WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY = 'YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-DONT-SHARE'

const RPC_API_KEY = 'YOUR-API-KEY-FROM-INFURA-OR-ALCHEMY'

/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.12',
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: RPC_API_KEY,
      accounts: [WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
}
```

And you need to fill those 2 global variables with your own for hardhat to
communicate correctly to the network.

We have already gone through how to get your API KEY.

For your wallet's private key, the most sensitive data of the project, you need
to open Metamask, click on the three dots next to your Account Name, and then on
Account Details, then click on Export Private Key. It will ask for your Metamask
password (the one you use to open it, NOT your seed phrase). It also shows you a
notice so you know that you are entering the danger zone. Confirm and you'll be
able to copy your private key. Paste it in to our `hardhat.config.js`

Please, if you are already a developer and you plan to use git to store your
project, don't store your `hardhat.config.js` on it, because you will have your
private key there.

PART 8 DEPLOY TO TESTNET

Ok. We are ready, let's deploy to the Goerli testnet!

Now we need to run our deploy.js script and the deployment is going to cost us
some eth (test eth, don't worry) from our wallet, since we are storing
information (i.e. our contract) in the blockchain. We only have to add 2 words
to the command to let Hardhat know we are doing the real thing now. Remember
our deploy script will create our contract AND mint one NFT. If you only want to
deploy, delete all the lines we added to test the minting.

Run:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

This is the output i got in my console:

![deploy.rinkeby.png](/assets/lessons/2/img_19.png)

Remember we are deploying to the actual blockchain, a testnet, but a blockchain
nonetheless.

Now that we have run the deploy script, delete the private key and the RPC API
key from `hardhat.config.js` to minimize the handling of the wallet. In the next
project we will learn about tools to collaborate and store your projects online

So now we can go and explore the chain to find your contract (and mine too!).
Just go to [Goerli Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/) (or
[Opensea](https://testnets.opensea.io/)) and search for the address of our
deployed contract.

You can view my links as an example on [Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x166A82F7cD8F7BA9D8C10b2cc792C1A20084564d)
and [Opensea](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/d-d-academy)

Wow, you have created your own NFT collection from scratch. What a superstar! You have learned tonnes of new concepts and code - that is really impressive! And now you're almost ready to test yourself a little bit more. 

But first, we want you to go and 'touch some grass'. So why don't you scroll to the top and set the pomodoro timer, and when you come back after your well earned rest, take the quiz. Breathe and enjoy.  

<br/>
<Quiz quiz="lesson-2-quiz" />
<br/>

Congratulations on your results. You're now a supreme open-sourcerer! See you in the next lesson, where you will be adding to your knowledge of creating ERC721s, by creating *tiered NFTs*. See you there....
