Here is the super quiz editor that our very own @Chiin created!

https://quiz-editor.vercel.app/

Why not check it out to create your questions and quizzes? 

See /quizzes/template-quiz.json on what the syntax for a full quiz looks like.....or just use the app to create one and see for yourself

A single question with ONE correct answer looks like this and the app will give you the following code. You can copy your own manually from the app:

{
  "question": "Apart from a user wallet, what else uses a blockchain (Ethereum) address?",
  "options": [
    {
      "answer": "Transactions"
    },
    {
      "answer": "Smart contracts",
      "correct": true
    },
    {
      "answer": "NFTs"
    }
  ]
}

TWO correct answers looks like this and you will need to add ", correct": true' yourself if you want multiple correct answers:

{
  "question": "Apart from a user wallet, what else uses a blockchain (Ethereum) address?",
  "options": [
    {
      "answer": "Transactions"
    },
    {
      "answer": "Smart contracts",
      "correct": true
    },
    {
      "answer": "NFTs",
      "correct": true
    }
  ]
}
