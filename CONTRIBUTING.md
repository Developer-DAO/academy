Welcome to the `Developer DAO Academy` project!

This is an open-source project, but at this early stage, we require contributors
to be members of the Developer DAO. Our project uses various Developer DAO
planning and communication tools, such as Discord.

To join the Developer DAO, I'd recommend reading our
[What is DeveloperDAO](https://blog.developerdao.com/what-is-developer-dao)
post.

Once you're a member, to contribute code or content:

- please join us in the Developer DAO Discord (`#d_d-academy` channel)
- setup the project by visiting our [README.md](./README.md)
- add code or content by forking this repo. You can then submit PRs for review.
- peruse our [issues](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/academy/issues) and
  [milestones](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/academy/milestones) here in
  GitHub

_Note: You do not need to be added to the GitHub Developer DAO organization to
submit PRs._
