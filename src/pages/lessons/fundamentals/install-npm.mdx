![NPM Overload Joke](/assets/lessons/install_npm/npm-jokes-1.png)

NPM is probably the best known package manager for setting up and running a
`node.js` project. When `node.js` is installed, `npm` gets installed with it, so
there is no need to install `npm` separately. NPM sets up the development
environment of your project, which in our case we are using hardhat as our
development environment, and installs important dependencies, which are other
pieces of software that are needed to help the core software of the project run.
Examples of dependencies are OpenZeppelin/contracts, ethers.js, chai or
typescript.

Choose your operating system and setup from the choices below:

## Installing node.js and npm with nvm on Windows 10/WSL2

If your operating system is Windows 10 or 11 and you have not installed WSL-2
yet, Microsoft has a pretty good article that can help you install Linux on your
Windows machine here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install . One
minor change to the directions should be to the commands to add a specific
distribution. You will want to choose the Ubuntu Linux distribution, so you will
want to use the following command when installing WSL with the command line,
`wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`. This will ensure that a long-term supported
version of Ubuntu Linux is installed on WSL-2. If you need additional info, you
can also refer to the Tooling section of Lesson 2, which gives direction on
operating systems, a command line mini-lesson and more.

Let‚Äôs get the party started and install `npm` on WSL2!

Click on the Window, then open Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows.

![WSL2 in Windows App List](/assets/lessons/install_npm/WSL2-open.PNG)

We need to install curl into our WSL-2 instance, so type into the command line,
`sudo apt-get install curl`. You may be prompted for a password. It is the same
password you created when you first set up WSL-2. You are prompted to use the
password because you are using `sudo` which is ‚Äúsuper user permission‚Äù. `cURL`
allows us to to download necessary software from outside software library
servers.

![WSL2 Install CURL](/assets/lessons/install_npm/WSL2-install-curl.PNG)

Next, we want to install Node Version Manager (nvm). NVM is a super helpful tool
because it allows you to download and run different versions of npm. In our
command line, we need to copy and paste the following command:
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`
and hit Enter. Let‚Äôs verify that it was installed correctly by typing
`command -v nvm`. This should return nvm if it was installed correctly. If you
get an error or no output, close the Ubuntu terminal down and restart it. It
should now return nvm.

![WSL2 Install NVM](/assets/lessons/install_npm/WSL2-install-nvm.PNG)

We‚Äôre all ready to install our first version of node.js! üëç For this demo, I
installed node.js version 14.16.0. In the command line type
`nvm install 14.16.0` and hit enter. This will install this version of node.js
and it can be verified by typing `node -v` for the node.js version and `npm -v`
for the npm version. In the event that you need a different version of node.js,
the commands `nvm install <VERSION>` will install the new version.

![WSL2 Install Another Node version](/assets/lessons/install_npm/WSL2-install-another-version.PNG)

After you have installed a few different versions of node.js depending on the
requirements of your projects, you can list the versions using the `nvm ls`
command.

![WSL2 List Installed versions of Node](/assets/lessons/install_npm/WSL2-list-versions.PNG)

To change the version from the list generated by nvm ls, you can type in the
command `nvm use <VERSION>`. In my case I wanted to use node.js version 16.17.0,
so I typed in  
`nvm use 16.17.0` and verified the node.js version by typing in `node -v` where
it returned v16.17.0.

## Installing node.js and npm on Mac iOS

Lucky Mac users! Your Terminal comes pre-loaded with Mac iOS. üòÄ After we find
the Terminal, we will need to install Homebrew, which is a package installation
software for Mac iOS. Once brew is installed, we can install node.js and npm.
The directions follow:

Go to Launchpad and type terminal into the search bar. This will bring up the
terminal icon. Click on the icon.

![MacOS Terminal Open](/assets/lessons/install_npm/terminal0.png)

![MacOS Terminal](/assets/lessons/install_npm/terminal3.png)

**Install brew by copy and pasting the command below:**

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

![MacOS Install Homebrew](/assets/lessons/install_npm/MacOS-install-brew2.png)

Copy and paste each of these 2 commands separately to set the correct PATH for
`brew`. MAKE SURE TO CHANGE YourUsername TO `yourOwnUserName` WITHOUT ‚Äú< or >‚Äù.

_`echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<YourUsername>/.zprofile`_

_`eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)‚Äù`_

Verify the installation by typing in brew , then Enter. You should see the menu
as below: ![MacOS Verify Brew](/assets/lessons/install_npm/MacOS-nvm-ls2.png)

Remove existing Node Versions. Even if you have never worked with `nodejs`
before, it is recommended to NOT skip this step. Execute the 2 commands
separately below:

`brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies node`

`brew uninstall --force node`

Install`NVM on macOS.** The following commands with`brew`and install`nvm`:

`brew update`

`brew install nvm`

Important steps to make the directory for `nvm` and set its PATH:

- Create the directory for `nvm`:

`mkdir ~/.nvm`

- Set environment variables in the `.bash_profile` file:

`vim ~/.bash_profile`

- Type the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù to allow ‚ÄîINSERT‚Äî, then type in the code below on the in
  the first 2 lines at the top:

`export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm`

`source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh`

- Press **ESC + :wq** to save and close your file.
- Load the variable to the current shell environment:

``source ~/.bash_profile`

- Verify the installation in the command line with `nvm` and it should return
  the following:
  ![MacOS Verify NVM](/assets/lessons/install_npm/MacOS-nvm-version.png)

Hang in there! We‚Äôre almost done! üëç üòÄ

Let‚Äôs install a few different versions of `nodejs` and `npm` (finally!üòÖ)!

- You can install the latest `nodejs` version with:

`nvm install node`

- In my case, I needed 2 specific versions of `nodejs` (also known as `node`)
  `16.10.0` and `14.16.0` because the dependency versions were needed for my
  particular projects. I install each separately using the following:

`nvm install 16.10.0`

`nvm install 14.16.0`

Verify our `nodejs` versions in `nvm`:

`nvm ls`

**You did it!! nodejs and npm have been installed with nvm. Woo hoo!!** üéâüí•

## Installing `node.js` and `npm` with `nvm` on Ubuntu Linux

Installing `nvm` on Ubuntu Linux is very easy. If it is a new installation of
Ubuntu, we will need to install `cURL`, then install `nodejs` with `npm`. Just
in case you were curious, `cURL` is a command line tool that developers use to
transfer data from one server to another, in our case to download `nvm`. After a
few easy steps, you will be up and running! üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- Install `cURL` if it is not already installed with `sudo apt install curl`.
  ![Ubuntu Install CURL](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-install-curl.png)

- Download nvm with cURL:
  `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash`
  ![Ubuntu Install NVM](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-install-nvm-curl.png)

- Rather than log out and log in again to set our environment for `nvm`, we can
  simply set the environment by executing: `source ~/.bashrc`

- Verify your installation with the command `nvm` and you should see the output
  below.
  ![Ubuntu Verify NVM](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-check-nvm-version.png)

- Install the latest version of `nodejs` (also known as just `node`) with
  `nvm install node`.
  ![Ubuntu Install Latest](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-nvm-install-node.png)

- Install a specific version of `node` with `nvm install <VERSION>`.

  ![Ubuntu Install Specific 1](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-install-16.16.0.png)

- Install another specific version of `node` with `nvm install <VERSION>`.
  ![Ubuntu Install Specific 2](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-install-14.12.0.png)

- List all of your installed versions of `node` with `nvm ls`. In my case there
  are several that have already been installed.
  ![Ubuntu List NVM Versions](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-nvm-ls.png)

- Let‚Äôs verify the current loaded version with `node -v` .

  ![Ubuntu Check Current Version](/assets/lessons/install_npm/UB-node-v.png)

- Now we can switch to another installed version using `nvm use <VERSION>` .

You made it to the end of our nodejs and npm installation with nvm tutorial!  
Congratulations!! üéâüí•ü•á
