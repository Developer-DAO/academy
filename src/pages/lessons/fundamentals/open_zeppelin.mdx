We are going to stand on the shoulder of giants and leverage the power of open
source to create our project in a simpler way, while not losing focus on
security which is super important in the web3 world.

In the early days of smart contract development, we developers didn’t have any
standard contracts, we just wrote our own, tested them as best we could, and did
a lot of _hoping for the best_ that they wouldn’t get hacked. Since the space
was new, there was a real need for developers who would specialise in rigorously
auditing contracts, since they were holding a lot of value.

The Open Zeppelin team, slowly but surely, began to fill that gap creating a
library of contracts that _have_ been rigorously audited and proven to be safe
and robust by all the OG protocols of the Ethereum Network, and many more.

**So what are they and how do they help us?**

By (re)using and these Open Zeppelin libraries, we devs can reduce the amount of
code we write, and that's a good thing. By reducing the _surface area for attack
vectors_ our contracts are much less likely to be hacked. Since they are often
used as an ecosystem standard, they allow for much easier collaboration among
humans, and interoperability with the technology those humans create in their
code.

In the beginning the OZ contracts were quite basic, but over time they have
gotten much richer and more modular, opening up loads of possibilities. And when
we pair this with the evolution of ERC standards and tokens, which we also look
at, the field of possibilities opens up exponentially. Exciting times to be
developing!

To make development easier still and take advantage of their offerings, there is
an OpenZeppeilin Wizard which lets you choose your own style of modularity,
whether that is to mint, burn, vote, give a range of access permissions, you
name it, it’s there! Note the import of ERC721 in the one below…..I’ll stop
nattering now! See for yourself:

So when we write a new contract, and we need to **_inherit_** the tried and
tested qualities or characteristics, we simply **_import_** those contracts into
our own, like inheriting those good qualities of our favourite relatives!

It’s very rare in the Ethereum smart contract development sphere to see a smart
contract that doesn’t include at least one line of code stating
`import 'OpenZeppelin_something_or_other.sol';`!
