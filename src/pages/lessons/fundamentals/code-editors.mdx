## What is an IDE?

![bug-in-your-code.png](/assets/lessons/code-editors/bug-in-your-code.png)

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an application that helps to
facilitate software development. It offers a code editor, compiler, and debugger
in one application, making programming easier. In addition, many IDEs also
include features like syntax highlighting and code completion.

## What to Look For in a Code Editor

Choosing the right code editor depends on the kind of projects you work on,
coding goals, and skill level.

To help you make an informed decision, check for the following features:

- **Optimized performance.**¬†Make sure the tool is fast and uses your computer‚Äôs
  resources as efficiently as possible.
- **Editor features.**¬†Look for features such as syntax highlighting,
  auto-completion, error and warning marks.
- **Navigation functions.**¬†Allows jumping quickly over segments of code to save
  keystrokes and bring us to our desired next point, compiling and debugging
  code, as well as moving around the editor in different ways.
- **Code references.**¬†Ensure the code editor provides highlighted references to
  same code to allow the user to change or delete the code.
- **Customizable.**¬†Look for a platform that offers both standard and
  personalized settings for a better working experience.
