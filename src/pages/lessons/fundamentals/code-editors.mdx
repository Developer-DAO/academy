## What is an IDE?

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an application that helps to facilitate software development. It offers a code editor, compiler, and debugger in one application, making programming easier. In addition, many IDEs also include features like syntax highlighting and code completion.


## What to Look For in a Code Editor

Choosing the right code editor depends on the kind of projects you work on, coding goals, and skill level.

To help you make an informed decision, check for the following features:

- **Optimized performance.** Make sure the tool is fast and uses your computer’s resources as efficiently as possible.
- **Editor features.** Look for features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error and warning marks.
- **Navigation functions.** Allows jumping quickly over segments of code to save keystrokes and bring us to our desired next point, compiling and debugging code, as well as moving around the editor in different ways.
- **Code references.** Ensure the code editor provides highlighted references to same code to allow the user to change or delete the code.
- **Customizable.** Look for a platform that offers both standard and personalized settings for a better working experience.
