## Web3 Storage

Among the many use cases for these great technologies, the most common are for
storage of image, audio and video NFTs as well as deploying web dApps. Here are
two protocols that specialize in decentralized data storage.

## Arweave

![Arweave Permaweb](/assets/lessons/ipfs-filecoin_and_arweave/arweave6.png)

Arweave is a distributed, permanent storage network. Built on top of the network
sits the Permaweb, which is a decentralized, permissionless web. The two layers
enable users and developers to:

&#8211; store data permanently

&#8211; deploy dynamic and permissionless dApps to the Permaweb

&#8211; write smart contracts in JavaScript, Rust, Solidity and more

&#8211; create profit sharing communities

### How does Arweave work?

The workings of the Arweave protocol can be best understood by looking at the
two layers involved: the Arweave network
and [the Permaweb](https://arweave.medium.com/welcome-to-the-permaweb-ce0e6c73ddfb).

### The Arweave network

A [P2P protocol](https://www.webroot.com/in/en/resources/glossary/what-is-peer-to-peer-networking)
that allows miners ([nodes](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/what-are-nodes/))
with large storage spaces on their hard drives to connect with the network and
store data for Arweave users. Arweave rewards these miners for offering their
storage services through sustainable and perpetual endowments, coming from the
user's one time payment to store data permanently. As the volume of data stored
in a particular system increases, the amount of
 [hashing](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/what-is-hashing-in-blockchain/)
needed for the consensus decreases, resulting in more cost-effective data
storage.

The network uses a blockchain like structure called blockweave. The
**_blockweave_** is different from the typical blockchain that many cryptos are
built upon because apart from storing transactional information, the Arweave
network can also store custom data on each block. Though similar to other
blockchains whereby each block refers to its previous, Arweave attaches a
randomly selected block known as the **recall block** to the transaction.

This Proof of Access consensus rewards the participating nodes in the network
for storing all of Arweave’s transactional history. Say you want to manage a
node on the Arweave blockchain. To receive block rewards, you must prove to
blockweave that you have complete **_access_** to the data in the previous
block, along with some randomly selected **_recall block_**. If you don’t have
access to the recall block, the network will know that you aren’t storing all
the transactional data on the Arweave network, and will thus deny you any block
reward.

### The Permaweb

Another main component in the Arweave network is the **_permaweb_**, a
community-owned, decentralized web layer built on top of the Arweave network.
Not only does the Permaweb host permissionless, decentralized and censor
resistant applications permanently, it gives us the ability to create queryable
transactions and smart contracts to build interactive and dynamic user
interfaces with tools like GraphQL.

## IPFS/Filecoin

</div>

**The textbook definition:** **IPFS** is a distributed system for storing and
accessing files, websites, applications, and data. **Filecoin** is a
peer-to-peer network that stores files, with built-in economic incentives to
ensure files are stored reliably over time.

### IPFS

The **IPFS** decentralized web is made up of all the computers connected to it,
known as _nodes_. Nodes can store data and make it accessible to anyone who
requests it.

If someone requests a file or a webpage, a copy of the file is cached on their
node. As more and more people request that data, more and more cached copies
will exist. Subsequent requests for that file can be fulfilled by any node or
combination of nodes that has the file on it. The burden of delivering the data
and fulfilling the request is gradually shared out amongst many nodes, so the
more popular the file, the deeper the _distribution_ of the file will be. For
IPFS, caching recall is shorter-term, unless using a gateway provider such as
[https://www.pinata.cloud/](https://www.pinata.cloud/), who provides over 200
caching locations allowing for speedy retrieval.

### Enter Filecoin

For longer-term storage, this is where **Filecoin** comes in. Filecoin is a
decentralized blockchain where miners are incentivized by payment in FIL, the
protocol’s native cryptocurrency, to store medium files such as videos, audios,
NFT images, NFT collections, scientific data. The Filecoin network allows for
**verification of storage** for users by accessing “proofs” on the Filecoin
blockchain.

## How is data stored on the traditional internet? 

The data storage behind the
traditional internet(Web2) is predominantly servers—physical or virtual—in
massive server farms or cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud. What
happens if the server farm is infected with a nasty virus and the entire
platform goes offline? These are centralized, potential points of failure which
we are “trusting” to stay online and continue to render service.

Decentralized web networks such as IPFS/Filecoin and Arweave solve this
centralization problem by distributing the data to nodes and eliminate a
central point of failure.
