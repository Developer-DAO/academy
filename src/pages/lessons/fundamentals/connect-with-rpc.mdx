**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** could be classified as a type of API
(application programming interface) that allows for developers to run code that
can be executed on servers remotely. In plain English, an RPC call is how a dApp
communicates with the blockchain or accesses other information from remote
servers. In this section, we will concern ourselves with RPC calls to the
blockchain via _Metamask_ to Ethereum testnets such as _Rinkeby_ and RPC
endpoint providers such as _Infura_, _Alchemy_, _Chainstack_, and _Ankr_.

### Connecting to a Testnet with Metamask

When opening up the Metamask browser extension, we can connect to the various
testnets by clicking on the pull-down menu as seen below and chose your desired
testnet network:

If you are trying to view a given networkâ€™s RPC connection information or add a
network, it can be accessed in the Metamask extension by clicking on the
Hamburger(round multi-color icon above) > Settings > Networks. In my case, I am
connected to the Ropsten testnet, so its Network Name, RPC URL, Chain ID,
Currency Symbol, and Block Explorer URL are shown below:

**Add a Network**

A new network can be added in Metamask by clicking on the **Add a network**
button and adding the 5 data inputs seen in the image above given in your
tutorial or other source.

## Connecting a dApp through an RPC Endpoint Provider

In blockchain development, it is necessary to connect your dApp to the
blockchain to deploy smart contracts and interact with the deployed contract.
This can be done by either running your own blockchain node such as GETH or
accessing the blockchain through an RPC endpoint service such as Infura,
Alchemy, Chainstack, Ankr, etc. Connecting through node providers is much easier
than running your own node. By using a node provider, it is quick, easy and
**FREE** to open an account and get access to RPC endpoints of many different
testnets including Goerli Ethereum, Polygon Mumbai, Optimism Kovan and Solana
Devnet. The websites for the aforementioned RPC endpoint providers can be found
below:

- **Infura**: [**https://infura.io/**](https://infura.io/) Click on the **SIGN
  UP** button.
- **Alchemy**: [**https://www.alchemy.com/**](https://www.alchemy.com/) Click on
  **Login**, then **Signup** under the Login button.
- **Chainstack**: [**https://www.chainstack.com/**](https://www.chainstack.com/)
  Click on the **Start for free** button.
- **Ankr**: [**https://www.ankr.com/**](https://www.ankr.com/) Click on **Get a
  free endpoint**, the **Connect wallet** to connect your Metamask wallet.

**IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK THE WEBSITE URL YOU ARE CLICKING
ON AND THE POP-UP MESSAGE IN METAMASK WHEN CONNECTING YOUR WALLET. IF YOU ARE ON
THE WRONG WEBSITE AND YOU ALLOW ACCESS TO YOUR METAMASK WALLET, YOU MAY BE
ALLOWING HACKERS ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET. BE SAFE!! ALWAYS DOUBLE-CHECK!!**
