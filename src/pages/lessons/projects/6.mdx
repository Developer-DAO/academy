## About this lesson

If you're eager to learn how to create your first ERC-20 token, you're in the
right place. There are a multitude of uses for the ERC-20, and we'll introduce
you to some of them. We'll be building a smart contract with a range of
developer tools, including the use of Foundry. If you are new to coding, we
suggest that you first complete our _Getting Started with Smart Contract
Development_ project, to get to grips with the basics of Solidity you'll need in
this lesson. And then move on to _Build a Basic NFT_ where you can get familiar
with using an IDE, wallet, RPC, testnet and Etherscan, all of which you'll be
using here to some degree. We also have a series of follow-up projects 'in the
works' to follow on from this tutorial, but let's get our focus on this one
first.

We'll have checkpoint questions at stages for testing your previous knowledge,
predicting next steps in the lesson, and helping you see how you're absorbing
the new content. You can also expect a final quiz, so make sure you're checking
out any additional material here for a deeper dive of the new concepts. To
complete the lesson, expect somewhere between one and three hours, depending on
your previous experience and the need to learn new ideas. Let's make learning
enjoyable by taking care of our well-being. We have a **pomodoro timer** ⌛ for
you in the menu header. Make use of it to take regular breaks, and please _do_
go outside and "touch grass." 😊 Nature is the source of much of our well-being.

## What are we creating?

By the end of this lesson you will have created your own ERC-20 token, and you
will be able to change its properties in any way you need. But before we go any
further, let's check-in and see what building blocks you have already.

We hope that was a little eye-opener for what's to come!

### Tokens, crypto, coins, ERC-20. Is it all the same?

Let's begin with some context, so we all speak the same language. The Ethereum
blockchain, and most EVM-compatible blockchains, have a native token that is
used to pay for transaction costs, and also to reward validators in Proof of
Stake (previously miners in Proof of Work). In Ethereum that native token is
Ether, or **ETH**, in Polygon its **POL**, and so on. But let's focus on the
Ethereum blockchain for the sake of clarity.

Every _other_ token or 'crypto' you see, use or interact with on Ethereum is
basically a smart contract that lets you send these tokens, receive them and
check your balance. Stablecoins like **DAI**, Tether (**USDT**), USD Coin
(**USDC**), or tokens from projects like Uniswap (**UNI**), MakerDAO (**MKR**),
Basic Attention Token (**BAT**) are all smart contracts that follow a standard.
The ERC-20 standard.

### Why would we want to create yet another Token?

A lot of reasons, but here are some. The most fundamental one is that we are
learning, and want to know how the ecosystem works. Or we have a project, or DAO
that needs some means of governance, or a community that wants take some
ownership, be part of, or simply support our project. Maybe we need a token with
extra functionality that doesn't even exist yet. The possibilities are endless!

### What do we need to do with our Tokens?

Some basic functionality that our tokens need to provide are:

- Transfer tokens from one account to another
- Get the current token balance for an account
- Get the total supply of tokens available in the network
- Approve an amount of tokens from an account to be spent by a third-party
  account

Has someone created a battle-tested library for the standard? Yes. OpenZeppelin,
among others, has created an implementation we can inherit to create our own
tokens easily. Here is a quick overview of what a contract needs in order to be
called an ERC-20 Token contract:

<SideDrawer buttonText="More info on the ERC-20 Standard">

To achieve the functionality needed for an ERC-20 token, the standard requires
us to implement some methods and events.

```solidity
// Methods:
function name() public view returns (string)
function symbol() public view returns (string)
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)

// Events:
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

## Let's code, but first...

Before we start hacking away without any structure to follow, what is our actual
project's structure, and what do we want to achieve? Since we are _BUIDLING_,
I'd like to think of our project, or smart contract, roughly the same way as we
would build a house:

    * 1 - Foundations
    * 2 - Structure: Framing, Walls and Roof
    * 3 - Doors and Windows
    * 4 - Security
    * 5 - Final touches

Before we build, we need a stable, levelled surface to place our foundations so
we can build on top. The tools for coding and the project's file/folder
structure will be our foundations.

## Setting up Foundations

Before coding our basic contract, we need to create a project and set up our IDE
to code. Let's go into the folder where we store all our Academy projects:

```bash
## (OPTIONAL) create a folder for our D_D Academy projects
mkdir d_d_academy
cd d_d_academy
```

You can use whatever tools you feel confident with, or accustomed to. For this
example we will be creating a Foundry project, but feel free to use Hardhat, or
Truffle if that's your favourite flavor. The main focus of Foundry is that you
don't need to use Javascript at all, if you don't want to. All the tools are CLI
commands. For tests and scripts, you only need Solidity!

![foundry-banner.png](/assets/lessons/6/foundry-banner.png)

These instructions are for Linux and MacOS. If you use Windows, we **strongly**
recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), or else you'll need to build
the tools from source. Using WSL is an investment in the long term anyway, since
most development and Open Source work is done inside Unix environments. We
encourage you to try it. There is also a Docker container if you prefer it. All
options are detailed in the
[Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

To download Foundry, we need to run this command on the console:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will download and install the `foundryup` tool. It will also update the
$PATH environment variable inside your shell's config file. Please read the
output from this command to see if it detected your shell properly e.g. Bash,
zsh, fish... and follow the instructions to refresh your environment, or just
close the terminal and open a new one to be sure the environment has been
updated.

Now let's run this tool to install the Foundry toolkit:

```bash
foundryup
```

If everything goes well, you'll have four tools to run in the console: `forge`,
`cast`, `anvil` & `chisel`. Basic overview of each tool:

- `forge` tests, builds and deploys your smart contracts
- `cast` can make smart contract calls, send transactions, or retrieve any type
  of chain data
- `anvil` is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for
  testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC
- `chisel` provides an interactive environment for writing and executing
  Solidity code, as well as a set of built-in commands for working with and
  debugging your code, which makes it a useful tool for quickly testing and
  experimenting with Solidity code without having to spin up a full foundry
  project

Now we can create our project with:

```bash
forge init my_token
```

Let's see what our project looks like:

```bash
cd my_token
tree . -d -L 1
```

This command outputs something like this:

```bash
.
├── lib
├── script
├── src
└── test

4 directories
```

The folders in our project are used like this:

- `lib` dependencies: forge uses Git Submodules instead of Node Packages. This
  means it works with any GitHub repository that contains smart contracts.
- `script` scripts: automate transactions or deployment of our smart contracts.
  Scripts are written in solidity!
- `src` source: where our smart contract code will live
- `test` tests: write tests for our smart contracts also in Solidity!

The default project includes a basic smart contract. We can build it to see how
the `forge` commands work:

```bash
forge build
```

My output:

```bash
[⠒] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 22 files with 0.8.20
[⠃] Solc 0.8.20 finished in 4.35s
Compiler run successful!
```

And now we can test it:

```bash
forge test
```

My output:

```bash
[⠆] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Running 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 27631, ~: 28409)
[PASS] test_Increment() (gas: 28379)
Test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 27.32ms

Ran 1 test suites: 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)
```

As we mentioned earlier, we are going to use OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation.
To use it, we need to install OpenZeppelin as a dependency in our project. To
install dependencies in Foundry, we use:

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

This looks for the repo called `openzeppelin-contracts` from the GitHub user
`OpenZeppelin` and downloads it as a Git Submodule.

This is the output I got:

```bash
Installing openzeppelin-contracts in /home/myuser/d_d_academy/my_token/lib/openzeppelin-contracts (url: Some("https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts"), tag: None)
	...
	Installed openzeppelin-contracts v5.0.0
```

This lets us import OpenZeppelin contracts in our smart contracts. We need to
create a `remappings.txt` file in the root of our project:

```bash
forge remappings > remappings.txt
echo "@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/" >> remappings.txt
```

This tells `forge`, “Hey, anytime you hit `@openzepplin/`, look in
`lib/openzeppelin-contracts/` instead.”

Now that we have an overview of the tools and the OpenZeppelin's libraries
installed, we can clean up the files we won't use and start afresh:

```bash
rm script/*
rm src/*
rm test/*
```

Everything's ready, so let's go ahead and start coding Solidity.

## Create the Framing and Walls

We need our house to have a structure and a floor plan with walls dividing the
rooms. Let's think of that setting as the 9 methods and 2 events that we saw
earlier for our code to be ERC-20 compliant.

It's a great exercise to try and implement them from scratch, and we ecourage
you to do that once you start diving deeper into Solidity. It is also a great
challenge to do it, and later compare your code to battle-tested code like
OpenZeppelin's implemetation.

In this lesson we'll start by inheriting OZ's, and then choose the specifics
that _our_ token needs.

Let's start by creating a `MyToken.sol` file inside the `src/` folder with the
basics:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

contract MyToken {
}
```

Once we have that, we can import and inherit OpenZeppelin ERC-20:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
}
```

Now that we have the full implementation inherited, we still have to specify a
few more things before compiling, because the ERC-20 constructor **needs** to
receive 2 parameters, i.e. the token's name and symbol, or it will raise an
error. In order to do that, we define our constructor and call our inherited
contract's constructor:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}
}
```

With those few lines, we inherit all the functions and events we need.

One final consideration is adding a roof above ourselves, to be able to live in
and finish the structure around us. We have all the rooms and functions we
needed, but no tokens exist yet. What good is a house with no roof, or a token
with no supply? We can think of the initial allocation of tokens as the way to
put a roof on the house and finish the structure. If you choose not to have an
initial allocation, that's also valid and can skip this, but for our example
we'll allocate an arbitrary amount of tokens to the deployer of the contract on
our constructor:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialAllocation) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialAllocation);
    }
}
```

The internal function `_mint` takes care of creating the tokens and assigning
them to the `msg.sender`'s balance.

## Opening Doors to our house

We now have a full structure, with a roof to shelter us from the weather. The
only problem is that we didn't create any openings for anyone to enter or leave.
We can think of entering the house as `minting` new tokens or increasing the
total supply, and leaving the house as `burning` tokens or decreasing the total
supply. But these doors don't exist in our contract just yet.

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>

If you are planning on leaving a fixed total supply like the `initialSupply` we
used recently, that's also a valid approach and you don't need to create a
`mint` or `burn` function.

</Callout>

We need to create public facing functions to achieve this:

```solidity

// ... pragma + import lines

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    // ... constructor lines

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    // In case we have allowance from other address to transfer/burn their tokens:
    function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }
}
```

When we define our `mint` function, we decide who will be the receiver of said
new tokens. For the `burn` function on the other hand, we are only letting
holders burn their **own** tokens by using `msg.sender` as the address to call
the internal `_burn` function in the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation.

In a special case where someone approves operating on an amount of _their_
tokens, we create a `burnFrom` function to be able to burn within that approved
allowance from the other address. If we try to burn, or transfer, more than the
approved allowance, the ERC-20 implementation from OZ will revert the
transaction because that's required by the ERC-20 standard.

We have now created doors to our house, but we haven't put locks in them!

<SideDrawer

  <Question question="lesson-6/3-create-contract/Q5" />
</SideDrawer>

## Lock the Door!

In our present state, our functions for minting and burning can be called by any
address. That's ok for `burn` since people can only burn their own tokens, or
their approved allowances. But we don't want just anyone to `mint` tokens and
increase the total supply of our new token.

To be able to limit the access to minting tokens, we are going to use an
OpenZeppelin pattern called AccessControl to give granular access to
functionality within our code. For that we will inherit yet another great
contract from the OZ library. It basically lets us define **roles** and assign
or un-assign them to any address we need. In our case, we will only create a
`MINTER_ROLE` to allow access to our `mint` function:

```solidity

// ... pragma + import lines

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20, AccessControl {

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    constructor(uint256 initialAllocation) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        // Allow msg.sender to grant roles
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);

        // Grant MINTER_ROLE to msg.sender
        _grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender);

        _mint(msg.sender, initialAllocation);
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    // ... burn functions

}
```

Let's break down our changes in the code:

- Added an `import` before our contract definition
- Inherited `AccessControl` in our contract definition
- Created a `bytes32 public constant` variable for the minter role. The
  irreversible `keccak256` hash ensures security and prevents unintended changes
  to the role. As a fixed-size of 32 bytes, it is efficiently storable, and will
  incur minimal gas consumption.
- Inside our `constructor`:
  - Granted the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the contract deployer to be able to
    grant roles to others. Our contract inherits this by default from Access
    Control as the starting point for all admin roles.
  - Granted the `MINTER_ROLE` to contract deployer to be able to mint tokens
- Added the modifier `onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)` to the `mint` function to restrict
  its access

So, we basically imported `AccessControl` and inherited it to gain all its
functionality. We gave 'minter' and 'admin' roles to the address that will
deploy the contract, and then restricted access to our `mint` function.

Now any address that doesn't have the `MINTER_ROLE` granted, will revert on any
transaction that calls our `mint` function. Hooray! Our door is now locked, but
only for intruders!

## Final Touches and details

Congratulations! We have built a fully functioning token!

<SideDrawer buttonText="Here's my final Solidity code">

Here we have our fully functioning house, I mean... token:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20, AccessControl {

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    constructor(uint256 initialAllocation) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _mint(msg.sender, initialAllocation);
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }
}
```

</SideDrawer>

Given that we have our house completed, you might want to add some personalized
detail to it, like special furniture, wall paint, or make it a smart home.

With this in mind, we can add functionality to our token, in any non-standard
fashion. We are not going to cover any modifications to our code here, but we
strongly encourage you to be bold, creative and experiment with different
aspects for the token.

A few examples could be:

- A token that accrues or drips more tokens, depending on how long have you been
  hodling. Tip: you can override functions like `balanceOf` and
  `_beforeTokenTransfer` / `_afterTokenTransfer` from the inherited ERC-20
- A token that can only be transferred or received if you hold another specific
  token, i.e. an NFT from a specific collection
- A token that loses the balance if you don't transact or transfer it regularly

The possibilities are endless, and we want you to go wild with your imagination.

## House Inspection

Before we go to the Real Estate Register, we need to make sure everything is
working according to your local rules, so let's call an inspector to see if we
got everything right.

In our analogy, the inspector will be the Solidity compiler. Later on, when we
have more dexterity in this new realm we'll be adding tests to make sure
everything is spot on, but that's for another lesson.

Since we layed out our project using Foundry, we only need to step into our
project's folder and run one command:

```bash
forge build
```

Here's what I got in the console:

```bash
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠒] Compiling 10 files with 0.8.20
[⠑] Solc 0.8.20 finished in 252.16ms
Compiler run successful!
```

Everything compiled successfully and is ready to deploy.

If you have any problems here, since the compiler might have found some typos or
errors in your code, pay attention to the messages in the console and see if you
can find and fix them. If you can't fix them, you can go into our forum and try
to ask our community for help by explaining your error, the console output and
your configuration (OS, version, Foundry and Solidity version, etc.)

### Register your house in the Real Estate Register

Or... Let's deploy our contract!

Now that we have our house built, we need to register it so as to guarantee the
property rights. We can think of this as deploying our contract to a blockchain,
where our token will be fully functioning for every address that wants to
interact with it.

We are going to need a small amount of Sepolia ETH to be able to pay for the
transaction to deploy our contract. If you already have some Test ETH in
Sepolia, you can continue, if you don't you can always ask for some in the many
faucets that are online. Some options are:
[Alchemy](https://sepoliafaucet.com/),
[Sepolia Faucet](https://testnet-faucet.com/sepolia/) or
[Quicknode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia), but you can find
more if you search for Sepolia Faucet in any search engine.

We are going to create an `.env` file, where we will store our _secrets_. And
when we say _secrets_, we are specially referring to the private key to your
wallet. Never, ever share this with anyone, not even us. Anyone who gets hold of
your keys, can drain your wallet. This is why we strongly advise using a
separate browser profile, and most definitely a separate wallet for your
development activities, that should not hold anything with real value in it. It
wouldn't be the first time, even for experienced developers, to accidentally
upload the `.env` file to GitHub, and once it's on the internet we can consider
it to be, yes, public.

So, with that important notice out of the way, we create a new file in our
project's root folder called `.env` and fill it with this:

```env
RAW_PRIVATE_KEY=REPLACE_THIS_VALUE_WITH_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
ETH_RPC_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia
CHAIN=sepolia
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

Remember to replace the `REPLACE_THIS_VALUE_WITH_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your
development wallet's private. In the spirit of OSS (Open Source Software) we
recommend you to also replace the `REPLACE_WITH_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` with your
Etherscan API KEY so you can verify your contract.

Overview of our values:

- **RAW_PRIVATE_KEY**: Here we shall paste our development wallet's private key
  after the `=` sign
- **ETH_RPC_URL**: This is the token from our RPC provider, we are using a
  public one but you can use POKT, Infura, Alchemy, Quicknode or whatever
  provider you prefer
- **CHAIN**: The blockchain where we will be deploying out contract. We are
  using the Sepolia testnet since this is not intended to be on mainnet.
- **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**: Here we will use our Etherscan API KEY so we can verify
  our contract for everyone to see the deployed code and foster transparency in
  the web3 space.

Once we have these values inside the file, we can source it to have the values
as enviroment variables before using Foundry's deploy tools.

There are many ways to load these values into environment variables, depending
on which shell you use e.g. Bash, zsh, fish... The next command works with most
of bash-compatible shells:

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

If you are using Fish or another shell, you can search on how to create a
function that does the same. Tip:
[envsource fish function](https://gist.github.com/nikoheikkila/dd4357a178c8679411566ba2ca280fcc).

Once we have those values in our environment, our Foundry tool to deploy will
know which wallet to deploy from, node or RPC in the blockchain to connect to,
and chain we want to deploy to.

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>

Remember that if you close your terminal session, all these variables with your
private keys gets wiped from memory, so you need to run this command again if
you want to continue the lesson at a later date.

</Callout>

We also need to pass our constructor 1 argument, our token's initial allocation.
All the Foundry tools expect values to be passed in `wei`, so we are going to
use `cast` to find out how many `wei` are, for example, 1000 `ETH`, or `MTK` in
our case:

```bash
cast --to-wei 1000
```

My output:

```less
1000000000000000000000
```

Now we can use this value when we need to deploy. To deploy our contract we will
use the `forge create` tool.

<Callout emoji='⚠️' size='md' variant='info'>

We don't **have** to copy our private key in the command! That's one of the
reasons to use the `.env` file - we know exactly where our private key is and we
are responsible to **not** publish this file anywhere.

We can even delete the private key **after** we deploy the contract. If you
write your private key in a command on the terminal, it gets stored in the
terminal's history, which could be in a publicly accesible file in your
computer. That's why we are using an `.env` file.

</Callout>

Notice aside, this is the command we can use to finally deploy our contract:

```bash
forge create src/MyToken.sol:MyToken \
    --constructor-args 1000000000000000000000 \
    --verify \
    --private-key $RAW_PRIVATE_KEY
```

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>

Remember that if you used a different name for your token and your `.sol` file,
you'll need to adjust this command.

</Callout>

Do you see how we used the value that `cast` gave us as a parameter after the
`--constructor-args` modifier? We are passing down arguments to our Solidity
constructor right from our command-line! How cool is that?

We also used `--verify` to let the tool know we want to verify our contract in
Etherscan. If you didn't fill your Etherscan API KEY, don't use this modifier,
or the tool will return an error when trying to verify.

This is the output I got:

```less

If by chance you get a message saying Etherscan hasn't detected or verified the
deployment, try running the command again.

By filtering through the information, we can pay attention to the second line,
where the tool tells us the address of the deployed contract:
`0xec870005029ED5595F146f6AAAe699b442065b72`.

## Querying the Block Explorer

You can go into [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) block
explorer and search for the address that the command returned to check out your
very own newly deployed smart contract!

![ERC20-etherscan](/assets/lessons/6/ERC20-etherscan.png)

If you got to verify it, you will also get a link to see your contract on the
block explorer. In our case, it's the last line of the _Submitted contract for
verification_ section of the terminal output
[Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xec870005029ed5595f146f6aaae699b442065b72).
**And** you get to see the code for the contract and all its libraries right
there in the tab named _Contract_ with the green checkmark.

If you scroll down, you'll see our code. It was the first file of the set for
me:

![ERC20-verified](/assets/lessons/6/ERC20-verified.png)

Etherscan also gives you a front-end to easily interact with the contract.
Inside our contract tab, you get 3 tabs: _Code_, _Read Contract_ and _Write
Contract_.

We can go and check for our balance by clicking in the _Read Contract_ tab, and
then searching for the `balanceOf` function:

![ERC20-balanceOf](/assets/lessons/6/ERC20-balanceOf.png)

Copy and paste your wallet's address - the one you used to deploy the contract,
and click _Query_. You should have as many wei as you passed to the constructor
when deploying. In my case it was 1000000000000000000000 wei and since we left
our decimals in 18, that would be exactly 1000 MTK.

### Invite your frens!

That's it! We deployed our contract on the Sepolia testnet, and our token should
be live and kicking. Now that we have built our house and it's has been accepted
in the real estate register, we can invite our friends by transferring them some
MTK, or maybe minting them some tokens, **even** if that affects your tokenomics
😉

### Consolidation

Let's take one more moment to consolidate the steps you've just mastered:

- You tested some of Foundry's amazing capabilities.
- Set up your foundations and created a project using Foundry tools.
- Built your own customisable contract utilising the power of `forge` for
  effortless compilation.
- Integrated OpenZeppelin, leveraging their ERC-20 and AccessControl
  implementations for enhanced functionality and security.
- Successfully configured your contract for deployment on the Sepolia testnet.

All in all, a very significant accomplishment!

So where do you go from here? In the future, we'll be adding to this ERC-20
series of lessons. But for now, why not explore _A Developer's Guide to
Ethereum_ three part track throught the lens of Python? Or complete the NFT
track, all the way from the back-end to creating your own front-end, building
your own Test Driven Development suite along the way. And of course, we have
lots of other goodies in the pipeline to get your developer juices flowing.
