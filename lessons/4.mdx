# Lesson 4: Testing your Tier NFT

In this lesson, we'll be adding automated tests for our smart contract created
in Lesson 3.

## Why automated testing?

Testing can:

- prove code actually works
- help you write more modular code
- ensure code doesn't break when you or others make changes or add new features.
  People new to the code-base may not even know when something breaks without
  tests.
- ensure a bug is fixed and won't come back again
- give you a safety net when you refactor code

Tests are a tool for writing your code and making sure it it keeps working as
expected when changes are made.

Automated tests don't fully replace manually testing your smart contract on
devnet, but it's an important tool to ensuring your contract will work as
expected.

## Let's add some tests

### First add a test framework

You've already setup hardhat in Lesson 2, which is a great framework for writing
automated tests.

Add a line in your `scripts` section of `package.json` so it looks something
like this:

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "test": "hardhat test --network hardhat"
},
```

Next create an empty test file to get started in a new `test` folder called
`tier-nft.test.js` with just these lines:

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai')

describe('TierNFT', function () {
  it('placeholder test')
})
```

`expect()` from the Chai library is used to test various conditions. There are
many examples in this lesson.

Now with a test file and a command to run the tests, try `npm test` and you
should see:

```bash
  TierNFT
    - placeholder test


  0 passing (5ms)
  1 pending
```

This now proves:

- hardhat is running ok
- the tests are found and are running

`pending` means we haven't added the real test yet, so it is neither passing nor
failing since no test code written. Adding `pending` placeholders are a good way
to brainstorm and remind yourself what tests you need to write.

## What do we want to test on our Tier NFT contract?

Now that the tools are setup, what should we test?

Let's look at our contract from Lesson 3:

    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public tokenTier;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol)
        ERC721(_name, _symbol)
    {}

    function mint() public payable {
        require(
            msg.value >= TIER_VALUE_0,
            "Not enough value for the minimum Tier"
        );

                    )
                )

        return string(abi.encodePacked("data:application/json;base64,", json));

        (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Withdraw failed");
    }
}
```

What is the contract trying to do?

- it accepts payment and mints NFTs
- it renders art as a SVG image
- it allows the contract owner to withdraw funds

If any of these functions are broken, you may not be able to mint NFTs, render
the correct art or withdraw funds at the end.

We want to test that those functions work in a variety of cases.

For example, we can test that a mint happens when enough Eth is spent and that a
mint fails if there is not enough Eth spent.

### Start testing constructor(), mint() and withdraw()

Let's start with the `constructor`. This one is pretty straight forward since
the heavy lifting is done by OpenZeppelin's base classes, but let's make sure we
can set the NFT name and symbol.

Let's take a leap forward with our first two tests, as well as some setup code
that we'll reuse for all the other tests too.

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai')

const CONTRACT_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_SYMBOL = 'Tier'

describe('TierNFT', function () {
  let contract
  let owner
  let otherUser

  beforeEach(async function () {
    const Contract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory(CONTRACT_NAME)

    const [_owner, _otherUser] = await hre.ethers.getSigners()
    owner = _owner
    otherUser = _otherUser

    contract = await Contract.deploy(COLLECTION_NAME, COLLECTION_SYMBOL)
    await contract.deployed()
  })

  describe('constructor', async () => {
    it('set proper collection name', async function () {
      const name = await contract.name()
      expect(name).to.equal('TierNFT')
    })

    it('set proper collection symbol', async function () {
      const symbol = await contract.symbol()
      expect(symbol).to.equal('Tier')
    })
  })
})
```

At the top we see constants with the name and symbol of the NFT collection:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_NAME = 'TierNFT'
const COLLECTION_SYMBOL = 'Tier'
```

Next is a `describe('TierNFT', function () { ...` line. What's cool about
`describe()` is that it logically groups tests together so you'll see nicely
organized output.

When we run the tests we see:

```bash
TierNFT
    constructor
      ✔ set proper collection name
      ✔ set proper collection symbol
```

Notice "TierNFT" comes from the first `describe()` block and `constructor` is
from the inner `describe()` block. The tests are then indented under there.
Makes for a nicely organized suite of tests.

Next notice the `beforeEach()` code block. When tests run it's important that
the contract is deployed from scratch for each test and this is where that
happens. "Before each" test, this code will run and re-inialize everything,
which prevents one test's results from interfering with another test.

What's the gist of what's happening in `beforeEach()`?

The hardhat framework give us the tools to deploy our contract to a
locally-running blockchain. So when this code finishes, we have a fully deployed
contract, and a couple of wallets to use for testing -- `owner` is who has all
the permissions since it deployed the contract, and `otherUser` is a wallet with
less permissions -- these will be handy when testing `withdraw` later on.

Those `let` statements above are to hold these values so we can use them
throughout all our tests.

Finally we then come across our first two actual tests:

```javascript
it('set proper collection name', async function () {
  const name = await contract.name()
  expect(name).to.equal('TierNFT')
})

it('set proper collection symbol', async function () {
  const symbol = await contract.symbol()
  expect(symbol).to.equal('Tier')
})
```

They each call a method and verify the results.

### Here are some general testing concepts:

- Tests should be as simple as possible. By moving setup code into
  `beforeEach()` that helps keep it easy to focus on the test itself. If you
  pack too much into a test, you could introduce bugs in the test code itself
  that may lead to incorrect results, and if something fails it may be hard to
  debug which piece actually broken.
- Therefore it's best practice to have many separate tests with one `expect` in
  each. In practice we could have tested both the name and the symbol in one
  test, but see bullet 1 above!
- And basically every test has two pieces (in addition to the `beforeEach()`
  setup code): a call of a method to be tested, and code to compare the result
  of that call with what's expected.

Lastly when you write a test, always make sure it fails first! So try changing
`expect` line to test the name `Anita` instead of `TierNFT`, run the test via
`npm test` and make sure it fails. If your test passes when you make an obvious
change like that, something is wrong with your test.

So after intentionally causing one of our tests to fail, here is what the
failure looks like:

```bash

  TierNFT
    construction
      1) set proper collection name
      ✔ set proper collection symbol


  1 passing (2s)
  1 failing

  1) TierNFT
       construction
         set proper collection name:

      AssertionError: expected 'TierNFT' to equal 'Anita'
      + expected - actual

      -TierNFT
      +Anita
```

### Let's add tests for mint()

Here are tests we'll be adding:

```javascript
describe('mint', async () => {
  it('should not mint if value is below the minimum tier', async function () {
    await expect(
      contract.mint({
        value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.001'),
      }),
    ).to.be.revertedWith('Not enough value for the minimum Tier')
    await expect(await contract.totalSupply()).to.equal(0)
  })

  it('should increase total supply', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.totalSupply()).to.equal(1)
  })

  it('should mint Tier 0', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.tokenTier(1)).to.equal(0)
  })

  it('should mint Tier 1', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.02'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.tokenTier(1)).to.equal(1)
  })

  it('should mint Tier 2', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.05'),
    })
    await expect(await contract.tokenTier(1)).to.equal(2)
  })
})
```

These tests introduce additional code that are helpful when testing contracts.

With minting, one needs to pay the right price, we should also see the total
supply of TierNFTs rise with each mint, and since we're minting 3 different
tiers, we need to test each one of those gets minted based on the right price.

The first test is a great example of how to test to ensure an expected error
occurs. If not enough Eth is sent, the contract fails with an error and the
transaction is reverted as if nothing happened.

So the heavy-lifting happens in the
`await expect().to.be.revertedWith('Not enough value for the minimum Tier')`
line. The code calling the contract has been temporarily removed to highlight
what's happening. We're expecting the call to be reverted when not sending
enough payment, along with a specific error message from the contract.

And the method inside that `expect()` method looks like this:

```javascript
contract.mint({
  value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.001'),
})
```

Here we're just calling `mint()` with a parameter that sets the amount of Eth we
want to send. In this case `0.001` Eth is less than our contract minimum of
`0.01` Eth so this correctly fails. Our test confirms this.

Now for the remaining mint tests, these all depend on a successful mint, so they
all need to mint with a minimum of `0.01` Eth. You'll see the same line at the
top of the remaining tests in this section.

And each of those remaining tests has a single `expect()` line to test the
various conditions upon a successful mint. The tier-related tests each put in
enough Eth to trigger a mint for the correct tier.

Notice each line tests the first token (`contract.tokenTier(1)`). Remember that
each test starts from scratch with no supply of NFTs, so after you mint one in a
test, you just have one token, the first one.

### Testing withdraw()

Let's look at testing `withdraw()` next with these 3 tests:

```javascript
describe('withdrawal', async () => {
  it('should error if not owner', async function () {
    await expect(contract.connect(otherUser).withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith(
      'Ownable: caller is not the owner',
    )
  })

  it('should error if balance is zero', async function () {
    await expect(contract.withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith(
      'Balance should be > 0',
    )
  })

  it('should success if owner', async function () {
    await contract.mint({
      value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    })
    expect(await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(contract.address)).to.equal(
      hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    )
    await contract.withdraw()
    expect(await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(contract.address)).to.equal(
      hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0'),
    )
  })
})
```

You'll see similar patterns from the `mint()` tests prior. Here are a couple of
additional highlights:

- In the contract, only a `owner` can withdraw funds, so the first tests changes
  the user to `otherUser` and makes sure that wallet can not mint. The snippet
  to change wallets before calling the method is: `contract.connect(otherUser)`.
- Another condition to test is that an error is raised if an owner tries to
  withdraw from a zero-balance contact
- Finally let's make sure an owner can successfully withdraw funds. Notice the
  `withdraw()` method call is surrounded by
  `hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(contract.address)` lines. When we mint we know
  the contract now has `0.01` Eth so we check that. Then after running
  `withdraw`, check the balance again and it should be back to zero since all
  funds withdrawn. Ok, yes we do have two `expect()` lines in one test that
  breaks our rule of one expect per test, but as long as the test is kept
  simple, we choose what makes sense for what we're trying to test.

### Testing tokenURI()

Here's where things get even more interesting!

Notice the current version of `tokenURI()` in our contract outputs a giant
opaque Base64 string that's not discernable by humans. For example the text
"Hello World" when encoded is `SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=`
([Base64 encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/))

This is impossible to test because if you make a change to the code, you get a
different Base64 string but how do you know if it's correct?

You need to refactor this method into smaller helper methods, each which are
more testable.

But first let's use the power of testing to make sure we don't break the
implementation as we refactor. Let's wrap `tokenURI()` with a test that **DOES**
capture this opaque string. This gives us a "safety net" as we refactor our
code. If we break things while dividing this problem into helper methods, the
test will help us discover that. We can then toss this test at the end.

Here's an example of what that looks like:

```javascript
it('should return base64-encoded data for tokenURI for Tier 0', async function () {
  await contract.mint({
    value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
  })
  await expect(await contract.tokenURI(1)).to.equal(
    'data:application/json;base64, <full string removed to fit in lesson>',
  )
})
```

First, here's the new contract that now contains a bunch of new helper methods
to make `tokenURI()` testing possible.

You'll still see `tokenURI()` but its implementation now calls several new
helper methods.

Let's quickly describe the new helper methods you'll see below. Each one breaks
down the "create an encoded SVG" problem into manageable functions that can each
be tested and understood by humans writing these tests.

- `tierNameOf()` just takes one of 3 tiers and returns the name of that tier.
  Easy to test!
- `imageSVGOf()` just concatenates three values into a string. Also easy to
  test.
- `finalJSON` also just concatenates multiple values into a string, and like the
  method says, it creates a string that represents the final JSON blob.
- Notice that none of these methods does the Base64 encoding, which immediately
  makes it impossible for a human to interpret the results and that makes for a
  bad test.
- So that does leave some lifting at the end still in `tokenURI()` but it's much
  simpler now. It calls well-tested helper methods that do the heavy lifting and
  finally does the dreaded Base64 encoding. Which tests, and how many to write,
  is subjective. In this case the non-automated-tested part is minimized and a
  test wasn't added. Though it is possible someone will come along, and with a
  typo break this file. It's up to you as a tester to decided if more tests are
  needed for peace of mind.

Ok, here are some tests for these helpers!

<ContentCallout emoji="💡" size="md" variant="info">
  Since an SVG is basically a bunch of strings, you'll notice all these tests
  are nearly simple single lines -- but they're comparing the results with long
  strings that eventually make up the final SVG.

The final test is an example mentioned earlier about adding a test before
refactoring with helper methods. It checks that the initial `tokenURI()` method
(which returns an encoded Base64 string) returns the right result. It's helpful
while refactoring to make sure we didn't break things along the way, and it's
helpful at the end to ensure the `tokenURI()` method continues to work without
fail when code changes.

## Food for Thought

With all the helpfulness of tests, why didn't we start with tests before we
wrote any of the contract implementation?

The main reason was trying to minimize all the things you needed to learn to get
started, but the methodology when writing tests first is called "Test Driven
Development" (TDD).

TDD is a very powerful methodology which goes like this:

- before you write implementation code, you write one or more tests and run
  them.
- of course those tests fail initially since there are methods that don't have
  any implementaiton yet. As mentioned earlier, it's always important to prove
  your test fails initially.
- then add your implementation until the tests pass.

Voila!

With TDD:

- you would have written tests as you go, which are much more fun to write than
  all at once at the end
- you would have ended up writing better code because you discover quickly when
  code is impossible to test. You'll end up with added benefit of breaking a big
  method into multiple smaller methods that are easily testable. So in the
  refactor example above for `tokenURI()` you would never have written the
  version that outputs a long base64 string because it's not testable.

  Bolting on tests after the fact can be painful, boring and you lose the
  potential code improvements you would have made if you tested as you go.

Go forth, test, and prosper knowing you have confidence in the code you're
deploying into the world.
