# How to install node.js and npm

![NPM Overload Joke](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/npm-jokes-1.png)

(Does the **bold** font add or take away from the viewer's experience?)

**NPM is probably the best known package manager for setting up and running a `node.js`** 
**project. When `node.js` is installed, `npm` gets installed with it, so there is no need to install** 
**`npm` separately. NPM sets up the development environment of your project, which in our case we**
**are using hardhat as our development environment, and installs important dependencies,** 
**which are other pieces of software that are needed to help the core software of the project run.**  
**Examples of dependencies are OpenZeppelin/contracts, ethers.js, chai or typescript.** 

<h3>Choose your operating system and setup from the choices below:</h3>

<h2>Installing node.js and npm with nvm on Windows 10/WSL2</h2>

**If your operating system is Windows 10 or 11 and you have not installed WSL-2 yet,** 
**Microsoft has a pretty good article that can help you install Linux on your Windows machine** 
**here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install .  One minor change to the** 
**directions should be to the commands to add a specific distribution. You will want to** 
**choose the Ubuntu Linux distribution, so you will want to use the following command when** 
**installing WSL with the command line, wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04. This will ensure** 
**that a long-term supported version of Ubuntu Linux is installed on WSL-2. If you need** 
**additional info, you can also refer to the Tooling section of Lesson 2, which gives direction on** 
**operating systems, a command line mini-lesson and more.**

<h3>Let’s get the party started and install `npm` on WSL2!</h3>

<h3>Click on the Windows Start Button, then open Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows.</h3>

**We need to install curl into our WSL-2 instance, so type into the command line,** 
**`sudo apt-get install curl`. You may be prompted for a password. It is the same password** 
**you created when you first set up WSL-2. You are prompted to use the password because you are** 
**using `sudo` which is “super user permission”. `cURL` allows us to to download necessary software**
**from outside software library servers.**

**Next, we want to install Node Version Manager (nvm). NVM is a super helpful tool because** 
**it allows you to download and run different versions of npm. In our command line, we need to** 
**copy and paste the following command:**
**`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`** 
**and hit Enter. Let’s verify that it was installed correctly by typing `command -v nvm`.** 
**This should return nvm if it was installed correctly. If you get an error or no output,** 
**close the Ubuntu terminal down and restart it. It should now return nvm.**

![WSL2 Install NVM](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/WSL-install-nvm2.PNG)

**We’re all ready to install our first version of node.js! 👍 For this demo,** 
**I installed node.js version 14.16.0. In the command line type `nvm install 16.17.0`** 
**and hit enter. This will install this version of node.js and it can be verified by** 
**typing `node -v` for the node.js version and `npm -v` for the npm version. In the event** 
**that you need a different version of node.js, the commands `nvm install <VERSION>` will** 
**install the new version.**

**After you have installed a few different versions of node.js depending on the requirements** 
**of your projects, you can list the versions using the `nvm ls` command.**

![WSL2 List Installed versions of Node](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/list-installed-versions-of-node.PNG)

**To change the version from the list generated by nvm ls, you can type in the command** 
**`nvm use <VERSION>`. In my case I wanted to use node.js version 16.17.0, so I typed in**                 
**`nvm use 16.17.0` and verified the node.js version by typing in `node -v` where it returned v16.16.0.**

<h2>Installing node.js and  npm on Mac iOS</h2>

**Lucky Mac users! Your Terminal comes pre-loaded with Mac iOS.** 😀 
**After we find the Terminal, we will need to install Homebrew, which is** 
**a package installation software for Mac iOS. Once brew is installed, we** 
**can install node.js and npm. The directions follow:**

Go to Launchpad and type terminal into the search bar. This will bring 
up the terminal icon. Click on the icon.

![MacOS Terminal Open](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/terminal0.png)

**Install brew by copy and pasting the command below:**

   `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

![MacOS Install Homebrew](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/MacOS-install-brew2.png)

**Copy and paste each of these 2 commands separately to set the correct PATH for `brew`.** 
**MAKE SURE TO CHANGE YourUsername TO `yourOwnUserName` WITHOUT “< or >”.**

*`echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<YourUsername>/.zprofile`*

*`eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)”`*


**Verify the installation by typing in brew , then Enter. You should see the menu as below:**
![MacOS Verify Brew](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/MacOS-nvm-ls2.png)


**Remove existing Node Versions**. Even if you have never worked with `nodejs` before, it is 
recommended to NOT skip this step. Execute the 2 commands separately below:

`brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies node`

`brew uninstall --force node`


**`Install` NVM on macOS.** The following commands with `brew` and install `nvm`:

`brew update`

`brew install nvm`


**Important steps to make the directory for `nvm` and set its PATH:**

- Create the directory for `nvm`:

`mkdir ~/.nvm`

- Set environment variables in the `.bash_profile` file:

`vim ~/.bash_profile`

- Type the letter “i” to allow  —INSERT—, then type in the code below on the in the first 2 lines at the top:

`export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm`

`source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh`

- Press **ESC + :wq** to save and close your file.
- Load the variable to the current shell environment:

``source ~/.bash_profile`


- Verify the installation in the command line with `nvm` and it should return the following:

**Hang in there! We’re almost done!** 👍 😀

Let’s install a few different versions of `nodejs` and `npm` (finally!😅)!

- You can install the latest `nodejs` version with:

`nvm install node`

- In my case, I needed 2 specific versions of `nodejs` (also known as `node`) 
`16.10.0` and `14.16.0` because the dependency versions were needed for my 
particular projects. I install each separately using the following:

`nvm install 16.10.0`

`nvm install 14.16.0`


Verify our `nodejs` versions in `nvm`:

`nvm ls`

**You did it!! nodejs and npm have been installed with nvm. Woo hoo!!** 🎉💥


## Installing `node.js` and `npm` with `nvm` on Ubuntu Linux

**Installing `nvm` on Ubuntu Linux is very easy. If it is a new installation of Ubuntu,** 
**we will need to install `cURL`,  then install `nodejs` with `npm`. Just in case** 
**you were curious, `cURL` is a command line tool that developers use to transfer data** 
**from one server to another, in our case to download `nvm`. After a few easy steps,** 
**you will be up and running! 🏃🏾‍♀️**

- **Install `cURL` if it is not already installed with `sudo apt install curl`.**
![Ubuntu Install CURL](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/curl.png)

- **Download nvm with cURL:** 
    `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash`
![Ubuntu Install NVM](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/small-nvm.png)

- **Rather than log out and log in again to set our environment for `nvm`,**
  **we can simply set the environment by executing: `source ~/.bashrc`**

- **Verify your installation with the command `nvm` and you should see the output below.**
![Ubuntu Verify NVM](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/verify-nvm.png)

- **Install the latest version of `nodejs` (also known as just `node`) with `nvm install node`.**
![Ubuntu Install Latest](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/nvm-install-latest-node.png)

- **Install a specific version of `node` with `nvm install <VERSION>`.**

  ![Ubuntu Install Specific 1](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/nvm-install-16.10.0-ub.png)

- **Install another specific version of `node` with `nvm install <VERSION>`.**
![Ubuntu Install Specific 2](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/nvm-install-14.16.0-ub.png)


- **List all of your installed versions of `node` with `nvm ls`.**
  **In my case there are several that have already been installed.**
![Ubuntu List NVM Versions](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/list-nvm-versions-ub.png)

- **Let’s verify the current loaded version with `node -v` .**

  ![Ubuntu Check Current Version](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/check-current-version.png)

- **Now we can switch to another installed version using `nvm use <VERSION>` .**

**Congratulations!!** 🎉💥🥇
